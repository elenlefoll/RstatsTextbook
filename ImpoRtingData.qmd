# Impo`R`ting data

#### **Chapter overview** {.unnumbered}

Many introduction `R` textbooks postpone this section until much later because they include practical tasks that typically rely on datasets that are directly accessible as `R` data objects. In real life, however, research data rarely comes neatly packaged as an `R` data object. Your data will most likely be stored in a spreadsheet table or as text files of some kind. And -let's be honest- they will be more messy that you would like to admit, which this chapter and the next are crucial to learning how to do data analysis in `R`.

This chapter will take you through the process of:

-   Downloading data from a real applied linguistics study
-   Creating a Project in RStudio
-   Importing a `.csv` file as an `R` object in `R`
-   Examining a data frame object

In future chapters, we will continue to work with this data. We will learn how to "clean it up" for data analysis, before we begin to explore it using descriptive statistics and data visualisations.

## Accessing data from a real applied linguistics study

As we saw in Chapter @sec-OpenScholarship, it is good practice to share both the data and materials associated with research studies so that others can reproduce and replicate the research.

In the following chapters, we will focus on data associated with the following study:

> Dąbrowska, Ewa. 2019. Experience, Aptitude, and Individual Differences in Linguistic Attainment: A Comparison of Native and Nonnative Speakers. Language Learning 69(S1). 72–100. <https://doi.org/10.1111/lang.12323>.

![Title page from the journal Language Learning](images/Dabrowska_Title.png){fig-alt="Front page of an EMPIRICAL STUDY journal article published at Language Learning: Experience, Aptitude, and Individual Differences in Linguistic Attainment: A Comparison of Native and Nonnative Speakers by Ewa Dabrowska (University of Birmingham" width="461"}

Follow the DOI[^importingdata-1] link above and read the abstract to find out what the study was about. You do not need to have institutional or paid access to the full paper to read the abstract.

## Saving and examining the data {#sec-SavingData}

Click on the two links listed in Appendix S4 and download the two datasets. Save them in an appropriate place on your computer (see @sec-FoldersPaths), as we will continue to work with these two files in the following chapters.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
#### What's a good place to save these files? 🤔

If you haven't already done so, I suggest that you create a folder in which you save everything that you create whilst learning from this textbook. This folder could be called something along the lines of `DataLiteracyTextbook`, `2024_data_literacy`, or `LeFoll_2024_DataLiteracy` (see @sec-FileNaming). Then, within this folder, I recommend that you create another folder called `Dabrowska2019` (note how I have not included the "ą" character in the folder name as this could cause problems), and within this folder, create another folder called `data`. This is the folder in which you can save these two files.

## Using Projects in RStudio

One of the advantages of working with RStudio is that it allows us to harness the potential of RStudio Projects. Projects help us to keep our digital kitchen nice and tidy. In RStudio, each project has its own directory, environment, and history which means that we can work on multiple projects at the same time and RStudio will keep them completely separate from each other. This means that we can easily switch between cooking different dishes, say a gluten-free egg curry and vegan pancakes, without fear of accidentally setting the wrong temperature on the cooker or contaminating either dishes.

Regardless of whether or not you're a keen multi-tasker, RStudio Projects are a great way to help you keep together all the data, scripts, and outputs associated with a single project in an organised manner. In the long run, this will make your life much, much easier. It will also be an absolute lifesaver as soon as you need to share your work with others (e.g., your supervisor, colleagues, reviewers, etc.).

To create a new Project, open RStudio. Select 'File', then 'New Project...'. Alternatively, you can click on the Project button in the top-right corner of RStudio and then select 'New Project...'.

```{r include = FALSE}
#To do for Jan: Add screenshot with ellipse showing the second option.
```

Both options will open up a window with three options for creating a new project:

1.  New Directory (which allows you to create an entirely new project for which you do not yet have a folder on your computer)
2.  Existing Directory (which allows you to create a project in an existing folder associated with your project)
3.  Version Control (see @bryanLetGitStarted).

In @sec-SavingData, you should have already saved the data that we want to import in a dedicated folder on your computer. Here, a folder is the same as a directory. Hence, you can select the second option: 'Existing Directory'.

This will open up a new window. Click on 'Browse...' to navigate to the folder corresponding to your @DabrowskaExperienceAptitudeIndividual2019 project. If you followed my suggestions earlier on, this would be a folder called something along the lines of `Dabrowska2019`. Once you have selected the correct folder, select the option 'Open in a new session' and then click on 'Create Project'.

```{r include=FALSE}
#To do for Jan: redo the screenshot below. Call the file RStudioNewProject.png. It should show a new project being created in a folder called 'Dabrowska2019', itself saved in a folder called 'DataLiteracyTextbook'. The checkbox should be ticked and red ellipses should circle the buttons that need to be clicked 'Browse', the checkbox and 'Create project'. Add this information to the alt-text
```

![New project window](images/RStudioNewProject.png){fig-alt="New Project Wizard for Create Project from Existing Directory R Project. It shows the working directory: /Users/lefoll/Documents. There are three buttons: Browse..., Create Project and Cancel" width="440"}

Creating an RStudio project will have generated a new file in your folder project called `Dabrowska2019.Rproj`. You can see it in the Files pane of RStudio.

```{r include=FALSE}
#To for Jan: add screenshot showing File pane with Rproj file.
```

Note that the extension of this newly created file is `.Rproj`. Such `.Rproj` files store information about your project options, which you will not need to edit. More usefully, `.Rproj` files can be used as shortcuts for opening your projects. To see how this works, shut down RStudio. Then, in your computer file system (e.g., using a File Explorer window on Windows and a Finder window on macOS), navigate to your project folder to locate your `.Rproj` file. Double-click on the file. This will automatically launch RStudio with all the correct settings for this particular project. Alternatively, you can use the Project button to open up a project from RStudio itself.

```{r include=FALSE}
#To for Jan: add two screenshots next to each other showing these two options to launch a project.
```

## Working directories {#sec-WorkingDirectories}

The folder in which in the `.Rproj` file was created corresponds to your project's **working directory**. Once you have opened a Project, you can see the path to your project's working directory at the top of the Console pane in RStudio. The Files pane should also show the content of this directory.

```{r include = FALSE}
#To do for Jan: Add screenshot of RStudio window with ellipses to help users understands the paragraphs above and below this chunk.
```

Click on the "New Folder" icon in your Files pane to create a new subfolder called `analysis`. Your folder `Dabrowska2019` should now contain an `.RProj` file and two subfolders called `analysis` and `data`.

![Contents of the project folder as displayed by RStudio](images/WorkingDirectory.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of the Files pane of RStudio showing the contens of a folder entitled 'Dabrowska2019'. It contains an RProject file called 'Dabrowska2019.Rproj', a folder called 'analysis' and another folder called 'data'." width="440"}

## Importing data from a `.csv` file in `R` {#sec-ImportingDataCSV}

We will begin by creating a new `R` script in which we will write the code necessary to import the data from @DabrowskaExperienceAptitudeIndividual2019's study in `R`. To do, so click on the analysis folder to open it and then click on the 'New Script' icon in the top-left corner of RStudio and select 'R Script'. This will open a new, empty `R` script in your Source pane. It is best to always begin by saving a newly created file. Save this empty script with a computer- and human-friendly file name such as as `1_DataImport.R` (@sec-FileNaming).

Given that we want to import two `.csv` files, we are going to use the function `read.csv()`. You can find out what this function does by running the command `?read.csv` or `help(read.csv)` in the Console to open up the documentation. This help file contains information about several base `R` functions used to import data. Scroll down to find the information about the `read.csv()` function. It reads:

```         
read.csv(file, header = TRUE, sep = ",", quote = "\"",
         dec = ".", fill = TRUE, comment.char = "", ...)
```

This line from the documentation informs us that this function's first argument is the path to the `file` from which we want to import the data. It also informs us that `file` is the only argument that does not have a default value (as it is not followed by an equal sign and a value). In this function, `file` is therefore the only argument that is compulsory. Hence, in theory, all we need to write to import the data is:

```{r eval=FALSE}
L1.data <- read.csv(file = "data/Dabrowska_2018_L1_data.csv")
```

In fact, we could shorten things even further as, unless otherwise specified, `R` will assume that the first value listed after a function corresponds to the function's first argument which, here, is `file`. In other words, this command and the one above are equivalent:

```{r eval=FALSE}
L1.data <- read.csv("data/Dabrowska_2018_L1_data.csv")
```

The file path `"data/Dabrowska_2018_L1_data.csv"` informs `R` that the data is located in a subfolder of the project's working directory called `data` and that, within this `data` subfolder, the file that we want to import is called `Dabrowska_2018_L1_data.csv`. Note that the file extension must be specified (see @sec-FileExtensions). Note, also, the file path is separated with a single forward slash `/`. In `R`, this should work regardless of the operating system that you are using and, in order to be able to easily share your scripts with others, it is recommended that you use forward slashes even if you are running Windows (@sec-FoldersPaths).

Although the command above did the job, in practice, it is often safer to spell things out further to remind ourselves of some of the default settings of the function that we are using in case they need to be checked or changed at a later stage. In this example, we will therefore import the data with the following command:

```{r eval=FALSE}
L1.data <- read.csv(file = "data/Dabrowska_2018_L1_data.csv",
                    header = TRUE,
                    sep = ",",
                    quote = "\"",
                    dec = ".")
```

In the command above, `header = TRUE`, explicitly tells `R` to import the first row of the `.csv` table as column headers rather than values. This is not strictly necessary because, as we saw from the function's help file, `TRUE` is already set as the default value for this argument, but it is good to reminder ourselves of how this particular dataset is organised.

The arguments `sep` and `quote` specify the characters that, in this `.csv` file are used to separate the values on the one hand, and delineate them, on the other (see @sec-DSV). As we saw above, @DabrowskaExperienceAptitudeIndividual2019's `.csv` files use the comma as the separator and the double quotation mark as the quoting character. Note that the `"` character needs to be preceded by a backslash (`\`) (we say it needs to be "escaped") because otherwise `R` will interpreted it as part of the command syntax, which would lead to an error. Finally, the argument `dec = "."` explicitly tells `R` that this `.csv` file uses the dot as the decimal point. In some countries, e.g., Germany and France, the comma is used to represent decimal places so, if you obtain data from a German or French colleague, this setting may need to be changed to `dec = ","` for the data to be imported correctly.

## Checking that the data have been correctly imported

It is crucial that you check whether your data has genuinely been correctly imported. Here's a list of things to check (in that order):

1.  Were you able to run the import command without producing any errors? If you are getting an error, this is most likely due to a typo! Check the name of the file or press the tab key on your keyboard to get RStudio to auto-complete the file name for you. Also check that you have correctly written the name of the function and have all the necessary brackets and quotation marks.

2.  Has the `R` data object appeared in your Environment pane? Does it have the expected number of rows (observations) and columns (variables)? `L1.data` contains 90 observations and 31 variables. If you are getting different numbers, this might be because you previously opened the `.csv` file with Excel or that your computer converted it to Excel format automatically. To remedy this, ensure that you have followed all the steps described in @sec-DSVLibreOffice.

3.  To view the entire table, use the function `View()` with the name of your data object as the first and only argument, e.g., `View(L1.data)`[^importingdata-2]. This will open up a new tab in your Source pane that displays the full table, much like in a spreadsheet programme. You can search and filter the table in this tab, but you cannot edit it in any way (and that's a good thing because, if we want to edit things, we want to ensure that we keep track of our changes in a script!). Browse through the table and check that everything "looks healthy". This is much like visually inspecting and smelling ingredients before using them in a recipe. It's not perfect but if something is really off, you should notice it. Check that each cell appears to have one and only one value.

4.  Finally, use the `str()` function to view the structure of your data object in a more compact way. Using the command `str(L1.data)` will display a summary of the data.frame in the Console. The summary begins by informing us that this data object is a data.frame, that contains 90 observations and 31 variables. Then, it lists all of the variables, followed by the type of values stored in this variable (e.g., character strings or integers) and then the first few values for each variable. Especially with very wide tables that contain a lot of variables, it is often easier to check the summary of the imported data with `str()` than with `View()`, though I would always recommend taking a few seconds to do both. This is time well spent!

[^importingdata-2]: Note that, unlike the functions that we have used so far, the `View()` function begins with a capital letter. `R` is a case-sensitive programming language, which means that `view()` and `View()` are not the same thing!

::: callout-tip
#### Task 1 {.unnumbered}

Import both data files from @DabrowskaExperienceAptitudeIndividual2019 using the `read.csv` function as described above. Save the first as the `R` object `L1.data` (as in the example above) and the second as `L2.data`. Then, answer the following questions.

a\) In the two data files from @DabrowskaExperienceAptitudeIndividual2019, each row corresponds to one participant. How many L1 participants were included in this study?

```{r echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
check_question("90",
               options = c("90", "31", "221", "2790", "17"), 
               type = "radio",
button_label = "Check answer",
random_answer_order = TRUE,
right = "That's right!",
wrong = "Are you sure?")
check_hint("Use the command `View(L1.data)` to display the full dataset in a new tab.", hint_title = "<br>🐭 Click on the mouse for a hint.")

```

 

b\) How many L2 participants were included in @DabrowskaExperienceAptitudeIndividual2019's study?

```{r echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
check_question("67",
               options = c("67", "45", "90", "220", "306"), 
               type = "radio",
button_label = "Check answer",
random_answer_order = TRUE,
right = "That's right!",
wrong = "Are you sure?")
check_hint("How many rows does the dataframe `L2.data` contain?", hint_title = "<br>🐭 Click on the mouse for a hint.")


```

 

c\) Compare the data frames containing the L1 and L2 data. Which dataset contains more variables?

```{r echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
check_question("L2.data",
               options = c("L2.data", "L1.data", "They have the same number of variables"), 
               type = "radio",
button_label = "Check answer",
random_answer_order = TRUE,
right = "That's right!",
wrong = "Are you sure?")
check_hint("Remember that, in these two data frames, each colum represents a variable. Use the `View()` function to display the data frames and compare them.", hint_title = "<br>🐭 Click on the mouse for a hint.")


```

 

d\) You have saved the two datasets to your local `R` environment as `L1.data` and `L2.data`. What kind of `R` objects are `L1.data` and `L2.data`? You can find out by using the command `class()`. It simply takes the name of the object as its only argument.

```{r echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
check_question("data frame",
               options = c("data frame", "character", "integer", "tibble", "table", "list"), 
               type = "radio",
button_label = "Check answer",
random_answer_order = TRUE,
right = "That's right!",
wrong = "That's incorrect.")
check_hint("Use the command `class(L1.data)` to find out which type of `R` object `L1.data` is.", hint_title = "<br>🐭 Click on the mouse for a hint.")

```

 

e\) Why does the L2 dataset contain the variable `NativeLg`, but not the L1 dataset?

```{r echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
check_question("Because, in this study, all L1 participants have English as their native language.",
               options = c("Because, in this study, all L1 participants have English as their native language.", "Because some or all of the L1 participants did not wish to answer this question.", "Because this variable was removed from the dataset for data protection reasons.", "Because Dr. Dąbrowska decided not to collect this information for L1 participants."), 
               type = "check",
button_label = "Check answer",
random_answer_order = TRUE,
right = "That's right!",
wrong = "No, that's not it.")

```

## Importing tabular data in other formats

We have seen how to load data from a `.csv` file into `R` by creating an `R` data frame object that contains the data extracted from a `.csv` file. But, as we saw in @sec-DataFormats, not all datasets are stored as `.csv` files. Fear not: there are many import functions in `R`, with which you can import pretty much all kinds of data formats! This section introduces a few of the most useful ones for research in the language sciences.

We begin with the highly versatile function `read.table()`. The `read.csv()` is actually a variant of `read.table()`. You recall that when we called up the help file for the former using `?read.csv()`, we obtained a combined help file for several functions, the first of which was `read.table()`. By specifying the following arguments as we did earlier, we can actually use the `read.table()` function to import our `.csv` file with exactly the same results:

```{r eval = FALSE}

L1.data <- read.table(file = "data/Dabrowska_2018_L1_data.csv",
                    header = TRUE,
                    sep = ",",
                    quote = "\"",
                    dec = ".")

```

In @sec-DataFormats, we looked at a DSV file with a `.txt` extension that was separated by tabs. If we change the separator character argument to `\t` for tab, we can import this dataset using the same `read.table()` function:

```{r}

OfflineLearnerData <- read.table(file = "data/offlinedataLearners.txt",
                                        header = TRUE,
                                        sep = "\t",
                                        dec = ".")

```

@fig-BusterudEAData displays an extract of the dataset `AJT_raw_scores_L2.csv` from an experimental study by @busterudVerbPlacementL32023. Although this DSV file has a `.csv` extension, it is actually separated by semicolons. @fig-BusterudEAData shows that, in this dataset, the comma is used to show the decimal place.

![Extract of data file `AJT_raw_scores_L2.csv` from @busterudReplicationDataVerb2023](images/BusterudEA2023_data_snapshot.png){#fig-BusterudEAData fig-alt="To do for Jan"}

If you look carefully, you will also see that this dataset has some empty cells. This data can be downloaded from <https://doi.org/10.18710/JBMAPT>. It is delivered with a README file. As the name suggests, it is always a good idea to read README files! 🙃 This particular README explains, among other things, that in this file: "Missing data are represented by empty cells."

If you call up the help file for the `read.table()` function again, you will see that there is an argument called `na.strings`. The default value is `NA`. When we import this dataset `AJT_raw_scores_L2.csv` from @busterudVerbPlacementL32023, we will therefore need to change this argument to ensure that empty cells are recognised as missing values.

In addition to the file path, the command that we can use to import this dataset therefore specifies the separator character as the semicolon (`sep = ";"`), the character used to represent decimals (`dec = ","`), and empty cells (`na.strings = ""`) for missing values:

```{r}
AJT.raw.scores.L2 <- read.table(file = "data/AJT_raw_scores_L2.csv",
                          header = TRUE,
                          sep = ";",
                          dec = ",",
                          na.strings = "")
```

Once we have run this command, we should check that the data have been correctly imported, for example using the `View()` function:

```{r eval = FALSE}

View(AJT.raw.scores.L2)

```

```{r echo = FALSE}

AJT.raw.scores.L2 |> 
  select(ID:`L2.grade`) |> 
  slice(262:274)

```

Here, we can see that the data have been correctly imported as a table. The commas have been correctly converted to decimal points and the empty cells are now labelled `NA`.[^importingdata-3]

[^importingdata-3]: If you are wondering why some are labelled `NA` and some `<NA>`, that's because cell F125 in this table contains a hyphen (`-`) rather than either a numeric value or nothing at all for a missing value. As a result, `R` is interpreting this variable (`L3.grade`) as a character string variable rather than a numeric variable. In string variables, `NA` is printed as `<NA>`. If we were to analyse this data further, we would need to convert this erroneous `-` to an `NA`. We can actually do that in the `read.table()` function by specifying that missing values are represented by both empty cells and cells containing only a hyphen using the argument `na.strings = c("", "-")`. Download the data and try it out if you're curious!

#### Using {readr} from the {tidyverse} to import tabular files

The {tidyverse} is a family of packages that we will use a lot in future chapters. This family of package includes the {readr} package which features some very useful functions to import data into `R`. You can install and load the {readr} package either individually or as part of the {tidyverse} bundle:

```{r eval=FALSE}

# Install the package individually:
install.packages("readr")

# Or install the full tidyverse (this will take a little longer):
install.packages("tidyverse")

# Load the library:
library(readr)

```

##### Delimiter-separated values (DSV) files {.unnumbered}

The {readr} package includes functions to import DSV files that are similar, but not identical to the base `R` functions explained above. The main difference is that the {readr} functions load data into an `R` object of type "tibble" rather than "data frame". In practice, this will not make a difference for our work in future chapters. Hence, the following two commands can equally be used to import `Dabrowska_2018_L1_data.csv`:

```{r eval=TRUE}

# Import .csv file using the base R function read.csv():
L1.data <- read.csv(file = "data/Dabrowska_2018_L1_data.csv", 
                    header = TRUE, 
                    quote = "\"")

class(L1.data)

# Import .csv file using the {readr} function read_csv():
L1.data <- read_csv(file = "data/Dabrowska_2018_L1_data.csv", 
                    col_names = TRUE, 
                    quote = "\"")

class(L1.data)
```

Note that instead of the argument `header = TRUE`, the {readr} function `read_csv()` takes the argument `col_names = TRUE`, which has the same effect. There are a few more differences between the two functions

Just like `read.csv()` was a special case of `read.table`, the {readr} function `read_csv()` is a special variant of `read_delim()` that can be used to import data from all kinds of DSV files. Check the help file to find out all the options by running the command `?read_delim`.

##### Fixed width files {.unnumbered}

Fixed width files (with file extensions such as `.gz`, .`bz2` or `.xz`) are a less common type of data source in the language sciences. In this text-based files, the values are separated not by a specific character such as comma or tab, but by a set amount of white/empty space other than a tab. Fixed width files can be loaded using the [`read_fwf()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_fwf.html) function from {readr}. Fields can be specified by their widths with [`fwf_widths()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_fwf.html) or by their positions with [`fwf_positions()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_fwf.html).

### Importing files from spreadsheet software

If your data are currently stored in a spreadsheet software (e.g., LibreOffice Calc, Google Sheets, or Microsoft Excel), you can export in to `.csv` or `.tsv`. However, if you do not wish to do this (e.g., because your colleague wishes to maintain the spreadsheet format that includes formatting elements such as bold or coloured cells), there are functions to import these file formats directly into `R`.

For **LibreOffice Calc**, you can install the {readODS} package and use its `read_ods()` function to import `.ods` files. Details about all the options can be found here <https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/readODS/versions/2.3.0>.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Install from CRAN (safest option):
install.packages("readODS")

# Or install the development version from Github:
remotes::install_github("ropensci/readODS")

# Load the library:
library(readODS)

# Import your .ods data:
MyLibreOfficeData <- read_ods("data/MyLibreOfficeTable.ods",
                            sheet = 1,
                            col_names = TRUE,
                            na = NA)

```

Various packages can be used to import **Microsoft Excel** file formats, but the simplest is {readxl}, which is part of the {tidyverse}. It allows users to import data in both `.xlsx` and the older `.xls` format. You can find out more about its various options here: <https://readxl.tidyverse.org/>.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Install from CRAN (safest option):
install.packages("readxl")

# Or install the development version from Github:
remotes::install_github("tidyverse/readxl")

# Load the library:
library(readxl)

# Import your .ods data:
MyExcelData <- read_excel("data/MyExcelSpreadsheet.xlsx",
                            sheet = 1,
                            col_names = TRUE,
                            na = NA)

```

Finally, there are also several ways to import data from **Google Sheets**. The simplest is to export your tabular data as a `.csv`, `.tsv`, `.xslx`, or `.ods` file by selecting Google Sheet's menu option 'File' \> 'Download'. Then, you can simply import this downloaded file in `R` using the corresponding function as described above.

However, if you want to directly import your data from Google Sheets and be able to dynamically update the analyses that you conduct in `R` even as the input data is amended on Google Sheets, you can use the {googlesheets4} package (which is part of the {tidyverse}):

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Install from CRAN (safest option):
install.packages("googlesheets4")

# Or install the development version from Github:
remotes::install_github("tidyverse/googlesheets4")

# Load the library:
library(googlesheets4)

# Import your Google Sheets data using your (spread)sheet's URL:
MySheetsData <- read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U6Cf_qEOhiR9AZqTqS3mbMF3zt2db48ZP5v3rkrAEJY/edit#gid=780868077",
                            sheet = 1,
                            col_names = TRUE,
                            na = "NA")

# Or import your Google Sheets data using just the sheet's ID:
MySheetsData <- read_sheet("1U6Cf_qEOhiR9AZqTqS3mbMF3zt2db48ZP5v3rkrAEJY/edit#gid=780868077",
                            sheet = 1,
                            col_names = TRUE,
                            na = "NA")

```

Note that, as spreadsheet software typically allow users to have several "sheets" or "tabs" within a file that each contains separate tables, the functions `read_excel()`, `read_ods()`, and `read_sheet` include an argument called `sheet` which allows you to specify which sheet should be imported. The default value is `1`, which simply means that the first one is imported. If your sheets have names, you can also use its name as the argument value, e.g.:

```{r eval = FALSE}

MyExcelData <- read_excel("data/MyExcelSpreadsheet.xlsx",
                            sheet = "raw data",
                            col_names = TRUE,
                            na = NA)

```

### Importing data files from SPSS, SAS and Stata

If you’ve recently switched from working in SPSS, SAS, or Stata (or are collaborating with someone who uses these programmes), it might be useful to know that you can also import the data files created by programmes directly into `R` using the {haven} package. Details of all the options can be found here: <https://haven.tidyverse.org/>.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Install from CRAN (safest option):
install.packages("haven")

# Or install the development version from Github:
remotes::install_github("tidyverse/haven")

# Load the library:
library(haven)

# Import an SAS file
MySASData <- read_sas("MySASDataFile.sas7bdat")

# Import an SPSS file
MySPSSDataFile <- read_sav("MySPSSDataFile.sav")

# Import a Stata file
MyStataData <- read_dta("MyStataDataFile.dta")

```

### Importing other file formats

As you can imagine, there are many more `R` packages and functions that are available and allow you to import all kinds of other file formats including `.json`, `.html`, various database formats and files with complex structures (see, e.g., <https://rc2e.com/inputandoutput>). In this textbook, we will only deal with DSV files (@sec-DSV).
