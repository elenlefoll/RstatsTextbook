<h1>Data</h1>
<p>In this book, we are concerned with empirical research in the language sciences, in other words, with research that is based on the analysis of <strong>data</strong>. But what is ‘data’ exactly? Data can be collected via surveys, measurements, or observations. To begin with, however, these collected datasets are “raw”. Data only becomes <strong>information</strong> once we have analysed and interpreted the data in a meaningful way. Hence, just like uncooked pasta does not make a flavourful meal, we must learn to “cook” the raw data to obtain meaningful information.</p>
<p>What kind of data are analysed in the language sciences? To get a rough idea of the range of data types analysed in the language sciences, let us take a look at the IRIS database. IRIS is a public, open repository where anyone can deposit the data, materials, instruments, code, and tools that they used “for research into languages, including first, second, and beyond, and signed language learning, multilingualism, language education, language use, and language processing”. As such, it supports Open Science and Open Scholarship (see <a href="https://elenlefoll.github.io/RstatsTextbook/OpenScholarship.html">Chapter 1</a>).</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="types-of-research-data">Types of research data</h2>
<p>Given the wide range of methods used in language research, it is no surprise that they are so many different types of research data. Although the data types listed on the IRIS search page (see <a href="#fig-IRISDataTypes" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a> for extract) are very broad and the categories not clearly defined, the list illustrates well the breadth of research data types typically analysed in language studies. The first data type category, ‘Oral production’, for instance, can equally refer to text transcriptions of language users’ oral production, audio, or video files. It can also refer to either raw data or to (more or less) processed data. For example, a transcript of a conversation could have been automatically annotated for part-of-speech, meaning that every word would be marked for their word class (e.g., <code>This_DT is_VBZ not_RB raw_JJ text_NN data_NN ._PUNC</code>), or it could have been manually anonymised by adding placeholders (e.g., <code>Is &lt;NAME&gt; going out with &lt;NAME&gt;?</code>) indicating that certain words have been retracted for data protection reasons.</p>
<p>The second most frequent data type category, ‘Closed response format’, includes different kinds of questionnaires and tests. Questionnaires may ask study participants to disclose personal information relevant to the research questions using single or multiple-choice questions, such as what language they speak at home, how long they have studied a language for, or how old they are. Tests may be designed to assess participants’ language competences (e.g., in the form of a vocabulary or grammar test), as well as other aspects relevant to the research questions being investigated (e.g., short-term memory or baseline reaction times).</p>
<p>In this book, we will focus on research processes that happen post data collection. However, it is crucial to be acutely aware of the conditions and context in which the data that we are analysing were collected and pre-processed as these steps of the research process can entirely change the results of the data analysis. Imagine that we decided to compare the ability of two groups of French L2 learners. To this end, a language production test was administered to two entire classes of secondary school pupils learning French as a second language with two different teaching methods. If one group had 15 minutes to complete the test, whilst the other group had up to 60 minutes, the results would not be comparable.</p>

<p>In research, we typically differentiate between <strong>primary data</strong>, which is the data that you collected yourself, and <strong>secondary data</strong>, which is data that was collected by others. If you were to conduct a new study based on data that you found on IRIS, this would be a secondary data analysis.</p>
<p>Especially when conducting secondary data analyses, it is crucial that we have enough information about the data itself. This is <strong>metadata</strong>, i.e.&nbsp;data that describes other data. Metadata is crucial for finding, sharing, evaluating, and reusing datasets. Metadata can be generated automatically and stored within the data file. For example, unless this metadata was explicitly deleted or amended, Word files typically contain data describing who created the file, when it was first created, and when the file was last modified. For some data and projects, it also makes sense to create separate metadata files that contain additional or more detailed metadata.</p>

<p>Different data types come in different data formats. For audio files, you may be familiar with the MP3 format, but this by no means the only format in which audio files can be saved. Many other audio file formats exist, such as Waveform Audio File Format (WAVE) and Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC).</p>
<p>We can usually tell in what format a file is in by looking at its file extension. The file extension is the suffix of the file name. It comes at the end of the file name and is preceded by a dot. The file extension of a WAVE file is <code>.wav</code>, whereas that of an MP3 file is <code>.mp3</code>; hence the file <code>recording.wav</code> is a WAVE file, whereas <code>recording.mp3</code> is an MP3 file.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, many “modern” operating systems have a tendency to hide file extensions by default; in which case the files <code>recording.wav</code> and <code>recording.mp3</code> would both be displayed as <code>recording</code>. This is misleading and can lead to all kinds of problems. To ensure that you can always see the extensions of the files on your computer in the File Explorer (on Windows) or the File Finder (on macOS), follow these instructions:</p>

<p>In line with the principles of Open Science (see <a href="https://elenlefoll.github.io/RstatsTextbook/OpenScholarship.html">Chapter 1</a>), it is important to ensure that both the materials that were used to collect research data (e.g., questionnaire items, audio, image or video stimuli, language aptitude tests, etc.) and the data themselves are, whenever legally possible and ethically responsible, shared with the research community in open access. Sharing materials ensures that studies can be rerun with new participants. Sharing research data enables independent researchers to check published results and run additional analyses that may confirm, contradict, or expand the conclusions of the original studies.</p>

<p>In this experiment, participants were instructed to decide whether the sentences they heard matched the Playmobil images or not. Consider the following two sentences from the experiment:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<ol type="1">
<li><p><em>El barrendero se encontró con el cartero antes de que recogiera las cartas.</em><br>
[The street sweeper met the postman before he fetched the letters.]</p></li>
<li><p><em>El barrendero se encontró con el cartero antes de que recogiera la escoba.</em><br>
[The street sweeper met the postman before he fetched the broom.]</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Up until the point at which either <em>las</em> <em>cartas</em> [the letters] or <em>la escoba</em> [broom] are heard, it is unclear who “he” is. Whilst listening to either Sentence 1 or Sentence 2, participants were presented with <a href="#fig-Playmobil" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;4 (b)</a>.</p>
<p>The researchers measured how long it took for participants to look at the person referred to by the ambiguous pronoun “he”. In other words, for Sentence 1, they were interested in how long it took participants to focus on the postman and, in Sentence 2, on the street sweeper. These measurements were made using an eye-tracking device.</p>

<p>Imagine that you want to run an experiment similar to the one carried out in <span class="citation" data-cites="schimkeFirstLanguageInfluence2018">Schimke et al. (<a href="#ref-schimkeFirstLanguageInfluence2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>. To do so, you would like to reuse the Playmobil image files. These can be found on IRIS. In what file format do you think that the images will be archived?</p>
<p>To find out, click <a href="https://iris-database.org/search/?s_publicationAPAInlineReference=Schimke%20et%20al.%20(2018)">here</a> to go straight to the list of data and materials associated with the study. Next, find the “Pictorial” entry which contains the images. It allows you to download a ZIP file called <code>Images_online.zip</code>. ZIP is an archive file format that can contain one or more compressed files. Download this <code>zip</code> file.</p>
<p>Once the download was successful, navigate to the folder where the file was saved on your computer and unzip the file, i.e., decompress it and extract its contents:</p>
<ul>
<li>To unzip on Windows, double-click the file, select “Extract All,” select a folder, and then click “Extract.”</li>
<li>On a Mac, simply double-click the file to unzip it.</li>
<li>If you are using the Linux command line, use the command <code>unzip</code> followed by the name of the file to unzip it. You should find that the ZIP file contains a folder entitled “Images”, which contains 58 pictures of Playmobil figures.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="working-with-tabular-data">Working with tabular data</h2>
<p>Data may be collected with analogue means, e.g., by getting participants to answer a questionnaire on paper or collecting language learners’ work on paper, but, for quantitative analysis, even analogue research data are digitalised for the analyses. The data are then stored as text files in formats such as <code>.txt</code> or <code>.csv</code>. When researchers conduct an online survey, the data collected collected by the online survey platform (e.g., Qualtrics, SoSci, SurveyMonkey, Google Form) is usually immediately stored in the form of one or more table(s). These can then be exported from the survey platform in one or more tabular format (e.g., <code>.csv</code>, <code>.tsv</code>, <code>.xlsx</code>). Similarly, the results of most experimental and corpus studies will ultimately be stored in tables.</p>
<p>Tables can be stored in many data formats but the simplest and most widely used in linguistics research are text files with delimiter-separated values (DSV). In DSV files, each value (e.g., measurement or response) is separated by a specific delimiter character. In principle, any character can be used but the most common are the comma (<code>,</code>), tab (<code>\t</code>) and colon (<code>:</code>).</p>
<p><strong>Add example of a simple table to be printed as a table in rendered versions. This table should contain real data about public repositories for research data (e.g., Zenodo, IRIS, Trolling, HAL, OSF) with 4-6 variables such as research discipline: e.g., all/ linguistics), number of entries (as of May 2024), provides DOI (yes/no), online since (date), etc.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Print the same table as above, but this time as text in CSV format</strong></p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-word-of-warning-about-spreadsheet-programmes">A word of warning about spreadsheet programmes ⚠️</h3>
<p>You should be aware that opening DSV files in spreadsheet programmes can corrupt the files! Once a file is corrupted, it is often not possible to retrieve the original data so this is very bad news, indeed. Such problems are particularly frequent when opening DSV files with Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets. This is because the default settings in these programmes surreptitiously modify files upon opening. These ‘auto-format’ modifications include replacing certain values by dates (e.g., changing <code>3-4</code> to <code>March, 4th</code>) or numbers (e.g., changing <code>1.23E5</code> to <code>123000</code>)<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, removing leading zeros (e.g., changing <code>001</code> to <code>1</code>), or misinterpreting special characters (e.g., the value <code>-ism</code> will generate an error if the hyphen is interpreted as minus sign). Not only can these auto-format modifications lead to inaccurate data analysis, in the worst of cases, they can cause data loss. The problem is that, often, users do not realise what the programme has done in the background. How bad can this be? Find out by completing the task below.</p>

<p>For some Windows users, these auto-formatting issues can even occur without them having ever opened a file in Excel! 🤯 This happens when Windows applies Excel’s default settings to all CSV files.</p>
<p>To ensure that this does not happen to you, you should search in your Windows’ settings for ‘Default Apps’, and select ‘Choose default apps by file type’. Here you will see <code>.csv</code> listed as a file type, and next to this, you can choose which programme you want as your default for opening <code>.csv</code> files. If Excel is currently your default, you should choose a different programme. LibreOffice is a fine alternative.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>In scientific notation, ‘E’ stands for ‘exponent’, which refers to the number of times a number needs to be multiplied by 10. This notation is used as a shorthand way of writing very large or very small numbers. This is why “1.23E5” is interpreted by Excel as 1.23 multiplied by 10 to the power of 5, which is to say: 1.23 multiplied by 100,000.
