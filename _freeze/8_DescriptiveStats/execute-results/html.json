Experience, Aptitude, and Individual Differences in Linguistic Attainment: A Comparison of Native and Nonnative Speakers. Language Learning 69(S1). 72--100. <https://doi.org/10.1111/lang.12323>.\n\nYou will only be able to reproduce the analyses and answer the quiz questions from this chapter if you have created an RProject and successfully imported the two datasets from @DabrowskaExperienceAptitudeIndividual2019 into your local `R` environment (see @fig-DataLoaded). Detailed instructions to do so can be found from @sec-RProject to @sec-ImportingDataCSV.\n\nAlternatively, you can download `Dabrowska2019.zip` from [the textbook's GitHub repository](https://github.com/elenlefoll/RstatsTextbook/raw/69d1e31be7394f2b612825f031ebffeb75886390/Dabrowska2019.zip){.uri}. To launch the project correctly, first unzip the file and then double-click on the `Dabrowska2019.Rproj` file.\n\nBefore we get started, make sure that both the L1 and the L2 datasets are correctly loaded by checking the structure of the `R` objects using the `str()` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(here)\n\nL1.data <- read.csv(file = here(\"data\", \"L1_data.csv\"))\nstr(L1.data)\n\nL2.data <- read.csv(file = here(\"data\", \"L2_data.csv\"))\nstr(L2.data)\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n\n## Measures of central tendency {#sec-CentralTendency}\n\nIn @sec-RFunctions, we calculated the **mean** average age of L1 and L2 participants. Averages are a very useful way to describe the central tendency of a numeric variable - both in science and everyday life. For example, it is useful for me to know if a particular bus journey lasts, on average, 12 minutes or 45 minutes. As it's an average value, I am not expecting it to last exactly 12 or 45 minutes, but the average duration is nonetheless helpful to plan my schedule.\n\nIn science, we use **averages** to describe the central tendency of numeric variables that are too large for us to be able to examine every single data point. With very small datasets, averages are unnecessary. Imagine that a Breton[^8_descriptivestats-1] language class in Fiji has five students. Their teacher hardly needs to calculate an average of the students' vocabulary test results to get an understanding of how her students are doing. She can simply examine all five results!\n\n[^8_descriptivestats-1]: Breton is the Celtic language of Brittany (now in North-West France). With around 216,000 active speakers ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breton_language), 26/08/2024), Breton is classified as 'severely endangered' in the UNESCO's [Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_of_the_World%27s_Languages_in_Danger \"Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger\"). It would presumably be quite a feat to put together a class of five Breton learners in Fiji, an island country far removed from Brittany in the South Pacific Ocean with fewer than one million inhabitants ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiji), 26/08/2024)!\n\nNot only are averages of very small datasets unnecessary, they can, in fact, be misleading. Imagine that the five Breton learners got the following results (out of 100) on their vocabulary test:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n89, 91, 86, 5, 82\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf we calculate the average result of the class, we get:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(c(89, 91, 86, 5, 82))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 70.6\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis average grade does not describe very well how *any* of the students did: Four did much better than that, while one did considerably worse! The results of quantitative studies, however, typically involve much larger datasets so that averages *can* be a very useful way to describe central tendencies within the data. But it's important to understand that, depending on the data, different **measures of central tendency** make sense. Later on, we will also see that measures of central tendency do not suffice to describe numeric variables: **measures of variability** (@sec-Variability) and good **data visualisation** ([Chapter 10](@sec-DataViz)) are also crucial.\n\n### Mean {#sec-Mean}\n\nThe measure of central tendency that we have looked at so far is the **arithmetic mean**. When people speak of averages, they typically *mean* mean values.\n\nIn @sec-RFunctions, we saw that means are calculated by adding up all the values and dividing the sum by the total of values.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsum((c(89, 91, 86, 5, 82))) / 5\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 70.6\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nMeans are useful because they are commonly reported and widely understood. Their disadvantage is that they are very susceptible to **outliers** and **skew** (which far fewer people actually understand, see @sec-Distributions). As we saw in the example above, the fact that one 'outlier' learner did very poorly in her Breton vocabulary test led to a much lower average grade than we would expect considering that the other four test-takers did much better than the mean.\n\nMeans are also frequently misinterpreted as \"most likely value\". This is rarely the case. For example, in this example, 70.6 is not even a score that any of the five students obtained!\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"false\"}\n#### Your turn! {.unnumbered}\n\n[**Q8.1**]{style=\"color:green;\"} What was the mean English collocation test score (`Colloc`) of the L1 participants in @DabrowskaExperienceAptitudeIndividual2019?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<form name=\"form_499\" onsubmit=\"return validate_form_499()\" method=\"post\">\n<input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"\" name=\"answer_499\"/>\n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"Check answer\"/>\n<div id=\"result_499\"></div>\n</form>\n<script>function validate_form_499() {var x, text; var x = document.forms['form_499']['answer_499'].value;if (x == '66.31944'|x == '66.31'|x == '66.32'|x == '66'|x == '66.3'){text = 'That‚Äôs right, well done!';} else {text = 'No, that‚Äôs not it.

However, data in the language sciences frequently also include categorical data (see @sec-Variables). In the data from @DabrowskaExperienceAptitudeIndividual2019, this includes variables such as `Gender`, `NativeLg`, `OtherLgs`, and `Occupation`. We also need to be able to describe these variables as part of our data analysis. For such **categorical variables**, the only available measure of central tendency is the **mode**, which corresponds to the **most frequent value** in a variable.\n\nThe `table()` function outputs how often each unique value occurs in a variable.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable(L1.data$Gender)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n F  M \n48 42 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom this output, we can tell that the mode of the `Gender` variable in the L1 dataset is `F`, which stands for \"female\".\n\nWhen there are many different unique values (or **levels**), it makes sense to order them according to their frequency. To do so, we can pipe the output of the `table()` function into the `sort()` function (piping was covered in @sec-Piping). Note that, by default, `R` sorts by ascending order (`decreasing = FALSE`). We can change this default to `TRUE`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable(L1.data$Occupation) |> \n  sort(decreasing = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n                  Retired                   Student                Unemployed \n                       14                        14                         4 \n                Housewife            Shop Assistant                   Teacher \n                        3                         3                         3 \n          Admin Assistant            Factory Worker                 Policeman \n                        2                         2                         2 \n        Quantity Surveyor             Admin Officer             Administrator \n                        2                         1                         1 \n              Boilermaker             Care Assisant             Carer/Cleaner \n                        1                         1                         1 \n       Catering Assistant             Civil Servant                   Cleaner \n                        1                         1                         1 \n                    Clerk            Content Editor    Creative Writing Tutor \n                        1                         1                         1 \n Customer Service Advisor              Dental Nurse         Finance Assistant \n                        1                         1                         1 \n   Functions Co-ordinator                 Homemaker           Human Resources \n                        1                         1                         1 \n               IT Support             Manual worker           Nail Technician \n                        1                         1                         1 \nOffice Admin Co-Ordinator         P/T Administrator         Personal Searcher \n                        1                         1                         1 \n      Project Coordinator              Receptionist                    Roofer \n                        1                         1                         1 \n          Sales Assistant     School Crossing Guard    School Crossing Patrol \n                        1                         1                         1 \n          Senior Lecturer                    Singer         Student (college) \n                        1                         1                         1 \n   Student/Support Worker     Supermarket Assistant            Support Worker \n                        1                         1                         1 \n             Train Driver                 Unemploed       University lecturer \n                        1                         1                         1 \n                 Waitress       Warehouse Operative              Web designer \n                        1                         1                         1 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can see that, among the L1 participants, there were as many \"Retired\" participants as there were \"Student\" participants.[^8_descriptivestats-2] Hence, we have two modes. In general, modal values rarely make good summaries of variables with many different possible values or levels. This is why the mode is not suitable for numeric variables, unless there are only a few possible discrete numeric values (e.g., the values of a five or seven-point **Likert scale**[^8_descriptivestats-3]).\n\n[^8_descriptivestats-2]: We also see that these data needs cleaning before we can do any serious data analysis. There are also a few typos (e.g., *Unemploed*) and synonyms (*School Crossing Guard* and *School Crossing Patrol*) that we will need to standardise. This process is part of **data wrangling** and we will cover how to do this in a **reproducible** way in `R` in @sec-DataWrangling.\n\n[^8_descriptivestats-3]: A Likert scale is a type of rating scale used to measure attitudes, opinions, or feelings. It typically consists of a series of statements or questions with a range of possible responses, often on a scale from \"strongly disagree\" to \"strongly agree\". For example, in a study on language attitudes, participants might be asked to rate their agreement with the statement \"I think it's important to speak standard English in formal situations\" on a scale from \"1 (strongly disagree)\" to \"5 (strongly agree)\". The resulting variable will therefore consist of numbers ranging between 1 and 5. Note also that, strictly speaking, Likert scales are not numeric variables, but rather ordinal variables (see @sec-Variables). The numbers refer to different categories that describe an order of responses, rather than a quantity.\n\nCross-tabulations of more than one categorical variable (or numeric variable with just a few unique values) can easily be generated using the `table()` function. In the following, we cross-tabulate the additional languages that the L1 participants speak with their gender. This allows us to see that most male and female L1 participants did not speak another language other than English. Hence, for both the male and female subsets of L1 participants the mode of the variable `OtherLgs` is \"None\".\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable(L1.data$OtherLgs, L1.data$Gender)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n         \n           F  M\n  French   1  1\n  German   2  1\n  None    44 40\n  Spanish  1  0\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"false\"}\n#### Your turn! {.unnumbered}\n\nIn comparative studies, it is important to ensure that comparisons are fair and meaningful.

This is referred to as **univariate descriptive statistics** and is all about describing the distribution of the variables. A **distribution** is a way to summarise how the values of a variable are dispersed. It tells us things like the variable's most frequent values, its range of values, and how the values are clustered or spread out. Examining the shapes and patterns of distributions can help us understand the typical values of the variables of our data, identify outliers, and make informed decisions about how to analyse and visualise our data.\n\n### Distributions of categorical variables {#sec-DistCat}\n\nTables can be an effective way to examine the distribution of categorical variables. The `table()` function outputs the frequency of each level of a categorical variable. By default, the levels are ordered alphabetically.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable(L1.data$OtherLgs)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n French  German    None Spanish \n      2       3      84       1 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe saw that we can use the `sort()` function to change this behaviour.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable(L1.data$OtherLgs) |> \n    sort(decreasing = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n   None  German  French Spanish \n     84       3       2       1 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe `proportions()` function allows us to describe the frequency of each level of a categorical variable as a proportion of all data points. This is especially useful if we want to compare the distribution of a categorical variable across different (sub)datasets of different sizes.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable(L1.data$OtherLgs) |> \n  sort(decreasing = TRUE) |> \n  proportions()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n      None     German     French    Spanish \n0.93333333 0.03333333 0.02222222 0.01111111 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhen computing proportions, `0` corresponds to 0% and `1` to 100%. If we want to obtain percentages, we therefore need to multiply these numbers by 100. We can therefore see that more than 90% of L1 participants reported not being competent in any language other than English, their native language.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nOtherLgs.prop <- \n  table(L1.data$OtherLgs) |> \n  sort(decreasing = TRUE) |> \n  proportions()*100\n\nOtherLgs.prop\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n     None    German    French   Spanish \n93.333333  3.333333  2.222222  1.111111 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo round the values to two decimal places, we can pipe the `R` object that we created in the previous chunk (`OtherLgs.prop`) into the `round()` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nOtherLgs.prop |> \n  round(digits = 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n   None  German  French Spanish \n  93.33    3.33    2.22    1.11 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn addition to using frequency tables, we can **visualise** data distributions graphically. **Bar plots** allow us to easily compare the distribution of categorical variables across different datasets and subsets of data. For example, in @fig-OtherLgsGender, we can see that the distribution of additional languages spoken by the L1 participants is very similar in both the female and the male subset of participants.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Additional languages spoken by L1 participants in DƒÖbrowska (2019)](8_DescriptiveStats_files/figure-html/fig-OtherLgsGender-1.png){#fig-OtherLgsGender fig-alt='Two bar plots showing the additional languages spoken by the female and male L1 participants.

However, it also features a long tail towards the older years. We are therefore dealing with a **skewed distribution**. **Skewness** is a measure of asymmetry in the a distribution. Skewed distributions occur when one tail end of the bell is longer than the other. Here, the asymmetry is due to the fact that @DabrowskaExperienceAptitudeIndividual2019's L2 data includes quite a few participants who were older than 40 at the time of the study, whereas there were none who were younger than 20. As the tail is to the right of the plot, this is a **right skewed (or positive) distribution**.\n\nThe **median** is usually better than the mean for describing the central tendency of a skewed distribution because it is less susceptible to the outlier(s) contained in the tail of a skewed distribution (see @sec-Median). @fig-L2AgeDensityPlot confirms that the median is a better approximation of L2 participants' ages than the mean.\n\n### Normal (or Gaussian) distributions {#sec-Normal}\n\nIn a perfectly normally distributed variable, the mean and the median are exactly the same. They are both found at the centre of the distribution and the bell shape of the distribution is perfectly symmetrical. Hence, the skewness of a normal distribution is near zero.\n\nPerfectly normal distributions, however, are very rarely found in real life!

As we saw with L1 participants' age in @sec-NonNormal, measures of central tendency are not always very informative and can even be misleading. But, even when they are informative, they only tell us part of the story: the average value of a dataset, but not the **spread** or **variability** of the data. For example, a mean age of 25 might suggest a group of young adults, but without a measure of variability, we can't tell if the group is relatively homogeneous (e.g., all students in their twenties) or heterogeneous (e.g., with some participants in their teens and others in their thirties or older). Therefore, it is essential to report measures of central tendency in conjunction with measures of variability, such as the range, interquartile range, or standard deviation, to provide a more complete picture of the data.\n\nConsider the three distributions of ages presented in @fig-3NormalDistributions. As you can tell from their shapes, these are three normal distributions. They each have exactly the same mean and median of 35; yet they evidently correspond to very different groups of people!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show `R` code to generate the plot below.\"}\n# The {truncnorm} package contains density, probability, quantile and random number generation functions for the truncated normal distribution.

This is why both measures of central tendency *and* variability are important when describing numeric variables! Measures of variability help us to understand how far each data point is from the central tendency. Hence, for Group A in @fig-3NormalDistributions, we can say that all data points are pretty close to the mean/median of 35. In Group B, participants' ages are, on average, more 'spread out' to the left and right of the central tendency. And this is even more notable in Group C.\n\n### Range {#sec-Range}\n\nThe most basic measure of variability is one that you will already be familiar with: range. It is easily calculated by subtracting the highest value of a variable from its lowest value. For example, in @DabrowskaExperienceAptitudeIndividual2019, the range of results obtained by the L1 participants in the English grammar comprehension test is:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmax(L1.data$GrammarR) - min(L1.data$GrammarR)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 22\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBy contrast, the range of results in this same test among the L2 participants is:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmax(L2.data$GrammarR) - min(L2.data$GrammarR)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 40\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn practice, the range is usually reported by explicitly mentioning a variable's lowest and highest values as this is usually much more informative than the range itself. Here is how @DabrowskaExperienceAptitudeIndividual2019 reports the age of the participants in the published article:\n\n> The L1 participants were all born and raised in the United Kingdom and were selected to ensure a range of ages, occupations, and educational backgrounds. The age range was from 17 to 65 years \\[...\\].

This means that 50% of the data falls below the median and 50% falls above the median. Going back to the test results of our six learners of Breton in Fiji, this means that half of the class scored below `86.5` and the other half above `86.5`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmedian(c(5, 82, 86, 87, 89, 91))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 86.5\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can further subdivide the distribution into chunks of 25% of the data, or **quartiles** (see @fig-MakingIQR).\n\n-   The **first quartile (Q~1~)** is the value below which 25% of the data falls. In other words, the first quartile corresponds to a value that lies above one-quarter of the values in the data set.\n\n-   The **second quartile (Q~2~)** is the **median** and, as we know, half of the data (25% + 25% = 50%) are below this value, the other half are above.\n\n-   The **third quartile (Q~3~)** is the value below which 75% of the data falls. In other words, it is also the value above which the upper 25% of the data are.\n\n-   The **interquartile range (IQR)** is the range between the second and the third quartile: it therefore covers the middle 50% of the data. This is illustrated below with a growing number of imaginary Breton learners.\n\n![Animation showing the interquartile range of five different sets of values (Le Foll 2024. Zenodo. <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17440319>)](images/quartiles.gif){#fig-MakingIQR fig-alt=\"Animation showing the interquartile range of different sets of values. The set of values are listed in one column and aligned at their respective medians. The first and third quartiles are highlighted and the range between them is labeled interquartile range.\"}\n\nThe easiest way to examine a variable's IQR in `R` is to use the handy `summary()` function which, when applied to a numeric variable, returns a number of useful descriptive statistics including its first and third quartiles.[^8_descriptivestats-5]\n\n[^8_descriptivestats-5]: Quartiles can also be computed using the `quantile()` function, which takes two arguments: the variable and a value between 0 and 1 corresponding to our **quantile** of interest. We are interested in the **first** and **third quartiles**, therefore in the values below which lie one quarter (`0.25`) and three-quarters (`0.75`) of all the data.\n\n    To compute the first quantile (Q~1~), we therefore enter:\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    quantile(L1.data$GrammarR, 0.25)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    \n    ```\n      25% \n    71.25 \n    ```\n    \n    \n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n    For the third quantile (Q~3~), we need:\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    quantile(L1.data$GrammarR, 0.75)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    \n    ```\n    75% \n     79 \n    ```\n    \n    \n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(L1.data$GrammarR)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Max. \n  58.00   71.25   76.00   74.42   79.00   80.00 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom the output of the `summary()` function, we can easily calculate the IQR, which we know is equal to the range between the first and the third quantile.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n79 - 71.25\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 7.75\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the IQR directly using the `IQR()` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nIQR(L1.data$GrammarR)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 7.75\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe reason that the `summary()` function is probably more useful than `IQR()` is that, like the full range, the interquantile range is not usually reported as the difference between Q~3~ and Q~1~. This is because it is more informative to consider the first quartile (Q~1~), the median (Q~2~), and the third quartile (Q~3~) together to grasp both the central tendency of a set of numbers and the amount of variability there is around this central tendency.\n\nIn practice, quartiles are rarely reported as numbers. Instead, they are usually visualised as **boxplots**. Boxplots present a visual summary of a numeric variable's central tendency and variability around this central tendency. On a boxplot, the **box** represents the **IQR**. Its **dividing line** is the **median**. The **whiskers** and any **outlier points** represent the rest of the distribution (see @fig-MakingBoxplot). In other words, the lower whisker roughly covers the lower 25% of the data and the upper whisper the top 25% of the data. Boxplots are most often displayed vertically and are used to visually compare the main characteristics of distributions of numeric values across different groups (e.g., grammar comprehension across different language proficiency groups).\n\n![Animation showing the making of a boxplot (Le Foll 2024. Zenodo. <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17440384>)](images/boxplot.gif){#fig-MakingBoxplot fig-alt=\"Animation showing the making of a boxplot. The minimum, the maximum, the median and the other quartiles of a set of values get highlighted. As the set is turned into a boxplot, a box depicts the interquartile range with two whiskers connecting the sides of the box to the maximum and minimum. The median is also highlighted.\"}\n\nRemember that, in a perfectly normal distribution, the mean and median are equal. When a variable follows a normal distribution, its box is divided into two equal halves and the whiskers are of equal length (see @fig-NormalBoxplots).

Whereas the interquartile range (IQR) is a measure of variability around the median, **standard deviation (SD)** measures variability around the mean. In other words, if you report a mean value as a measure of central tendency, you should report the standard deviation along side it. However, if you report the median, than it makes more sense to report the IQR in the form of a boxplot (see @sec-IQR).\n\n::: border\nIn a nutshell, the standard deviation tells us how far away, on average, each data point is from the mean.\n:::\n\n¬†Considering the test scores of our five Breton learners, we already know that the standard deviation is likely to be large because the mean (70.6) is quite far away from all five data points.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n5, 82, 86, 89, 91\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo calculate how far exactly, we first measure how far each point is from the mean, e.g. for the first data point we calculate `5 - 70.6`, for the second `82 - 70.6`, etc.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nBreton.scores <- c(5, 82, 86, 89, 91)\n\nBreton.scores - mean(Breton.scores)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] -65.6  11.4  15.4  18.4  20.4\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs you can see, some of the differences between the data points and the mean value are negative, whilst others are positive. For standard deviation, we are not interested in whether data points are above or below the mean, but rather in how far removed they are from the mean. To remove any negative sign, we therefore square all these distances. The squaring operation (`^2`) also has the effect making large differences even larger.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(Breton.scores - mean(Breton.scores))^2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 4303.36  129.96  237.16  338.56  416.16\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nRemember that standard deviation is a measure of how different, on average, a set of numbers are from one another, with respect to the mean. We have just calculated the sum of the squared differences from the mean and we now need to calculate the average of these squared differences. To calculate the mean squared difference, we sum the differences and divide them by the number of data points.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsum((Breton.scores - mean(Breton.scores))^2) / 5\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1085.04\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis is the **variance**. The problem with the variance is that it is not in the original scale of our variable, but rather in squared units, i.e., here, in squared test scores, which is rather difficult to interpret! This is why we more commonly report the **standard deviation**, which is the square root of the variance. The square root function in `R` is `sqrt()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsqrt(sum((Breton.scores - mean(Breton.scores))^2) / 5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 32.93995\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom the above result, we can deduce that, on average, learners' test scores are 32 points away from the group mean of 70.6 points.\n\nOf course, there is a base `R` function to calculate the standard deviation. It is called `sd()`. However, if we use the `sd()` function to calculate the standard deviation of our five Breton learners' test scores, we get a slightly different result.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsd(Breton.scores)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 36.82798\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis is because, in practice, we almost always divide the sum of squares not by the total number of data points (*N* ), but by the total number minus one (*N*-1). This is the difference between the **population standard deviation** and the **sample standard deviation**. The population standard deviation is used when we have access to the entire population (e.g. all L2 English users worldwide!), which is rare in real-world scenarios. In most cases, we work with samples [e.g., as in @DabrowskaExperienceAptitudeIndividual2019, a sample of 67 L2 English users]. Dividing by *N*-1 gives us a more accurate estimate of the population's standard deviation based on our sample. It helps to reduce the bias in our estimate, making it a more reliable measure of variability around the mean.\n\nIn `R`, the `sd()` function calculates the sample standard deviation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsqrt(sum((Breton.scores - mean(Breton.scores))^2) / 4)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 36.82798\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWith a normal distribution, the standard deviation informs us about the width of the bell around the central tendency. In @fig-3NormalDistributions we saw that three normal distributions, all with a median/mean of 35 could have very different bell shapes. This is because they have very different standard deviations around that central tendency. Let us compare the distribution shapes of these three distributions in detail.\n\nDistribution A (@fig-DensityA) is a normal distribution with a mean of 35 years (xÃÖ = 35) and a standard deviation of one year (sd = 1).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Density plot of Distribution A](8_DescriptiveStats_files/figure-html/fig-DensityA-1.png){#fig-DensityA fig-alt='A bar plot of an age distribution overlaid with a density curve. The curve is symmetrical and bell-shaped with a median highlighted at 35 years and values from 32 to 38 years.' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nDistribution B (@fig-DensityB) is a normal distribution with a mean of 35 years (xÃÖ = 35) and a standard deviation of 5 years (sd = 5).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Density plot of Distribution B](8_DescriptiveStats_files/figure-html/fig-DensityB-1.png){#fig-DensityB fig-alt='A bar plot of an age distribution overlaid with a density curve. The bell curve is a lot wider than in the plot above: it features values from 18 to 52 years.' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nDistribution C (@fig-DensityC) is a normal distribution with a mean of 35 years (xÃÖ = 35) and a standard deviation of 10 years (sd = 10).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Density plot of Distribution C](8_DescriptiveStats_files/figure-html/fig-DensityC-1.png){#fig-DensityC fig-alt='A bar plot of an age distribution overlaid with a density curve. The bell curve is even wider than in the last two plots: it features values from 10 to 66 years.' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe standard deviation provides a single metric of the variability around the mean. This means that knowing the mean and standard deviation of a numeric variable is not enough to tell whether a distribution is (approximately) normal or skewed. Like the range and the IQR, a large standard deviation value indicates greater variability within a variable, but tells us nothing more. For instance, comparing the following two SDs tells us that there is more variability around the mean in L2 participants' grammar comprehension test scores than in that of the L1 participants, but nothing more about the distribution of the test scores in either group.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsd(L1.data$GrammarR) |>\n  round(digits = 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 5.01\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsd(L2.data$GrammarR) |> \n  round(digits = 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 13.48\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn this respect, boxplots are more informative (compare the above SDs with @fig-GrammarRBoxplots). To evaluate the full shape of a numeric variable's distribution, however, there is no alternative to plotting it as a histogram or density plot.\n\nIn sum, remember that, when describing variables, it is important to report both an appropriate measure of central tendency *and* an appropriate measure of variability. In addition, it is good practice to visualise the full distribution of a variable's values in the form of a table, histogram, or density plot (see Chapter 11 on data visualisation). This is because any combination of a single measure of central tendency and a single measure of variability can correspond to an array of different distribution shapes.\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"false\"}\n#### Your turn! {.unnumbered}\n\n[**Q8.21**]{style=\"color:green;\"} What is the standard deviation of L1 participants' age in @DabrowskaExperienceAptitudeIndividual2019?

But, first, we need to learn about **data wrangling** ([Chapter 9](https://elenlefoll.github.io/RstatsTextbook/9_DataWrangling.html)) to prepare our data for data visualisation and multivariable analyses.
