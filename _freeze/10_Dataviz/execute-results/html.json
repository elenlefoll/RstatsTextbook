The **Grammar of Graphics** [@wilkinsonGrammarGraphics2005] is a theoretical framework that defines a structured approach to building and understanding statistical graphs. We will focus on using the tidyverse package [{ggplot2}](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) [@Wickhamggplot2Elegantgraphics2016] to create effective data visualisations. The {ggplot2} is an implementation of the Grammar of Graphics (GG) syntax in `R`.\n\nThis chapter is divided into two parts: the first explains the \\[**syntax**\\] of the Grammar of Graphics [@wilkinsonGrammarGraphics2005] and how the {ggplot2} package works, while the second part focuses on the \\[**semantics**\\] of statistical graphics and provides an introduction to the many different types of data visualisations that can be created using the package.\n\n### Chapter overview {.unnumbered}\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn how to:\n\n-   Create and interpret bar plots to visualise categorical variables.\n-   Create and interpret histograms, density plots, and violin plots to visualise continuous numeric variables.\n-   Create and interpret boxplots to visualise the distribution of continuous numeric variables across different subsets of the data.\n-   Create and interpret scatter plots to visualise correlations between pairs of numeric variables.\n-   Create and interpret facetted plots to explore the relationship between three or more variables at once.\n-   Create interactive plots for data exploration.\n\n![Building a data masterpiece with {ggplot2} (artwork by [\\@allison_horst](https://allisonhorst.com/))](images/AHorst_ggplot2.png){#fig-DataArtists fig-alt=\"A fuzzy monster in a beret and scarf, critiquing their own column graph on a canvas in front of them while other assistant monsters (also in berets) carry over boxes full of elements that can be used to customize a graph (like themes and geometric shapes).

Stylized text reads: ggplot2: build a data masterpiece.\"}\n\n### Set-up and data import {.unnumbered}\n\n::: {.callout-warning collapse=\"false\"}\n### Prerequisites\n\nThis chapter assumes that you are familiar with the concepts of descriptive statistics explained in @sec-DescRiptiveStats, and the use of the data wrangling functions introduced in @sec-DataWrangling.\n\nAll examples and quiz questions are based on data from:\n\n> Dąbrowska, Ewa. 2019. Experience, Aptitude, and Individual Differences in Linguistic Attainment: A Comparison of Native and Nonnative Speakers. Language Learning 69(S1). 72-100. <https://doi.org/10.1111/lang.12323>.\n\nOur starting point for this chapter is the wrangled combined dataset that we created and saved in @sec-DataWrangling. Follow the instructions in @sec-filter to create this `R` object.\n\nAlternatively, you can download `Dabrowska2019.zip` from [the textbook's GitHub repository](https://github.com/elenlefoll/RstatsTextbook/raw/69d1e31be7394f2b612825f031ebffeb75886390/Dabrowska2019.zip){.uri}. To launch the project correctly, first unzip the file and then double-click on the `Dabrowska2019.Rproj` file.\n:::\n\nBefore we begin, we must load the `combined_L1_L2_data.rds` file that we created and saved in @sec-DataWrangling. This file contains the data of all the L1 and L2 participants of @DabrowskaExperienceAptitudeIndividual2019. The categorical variables are stored as factors and obvious data entry inconsistencies and typos have been corrected (see @sec-DataWrangling).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nDabrowska.data <- readRDS(file = here(\"data\", \"processed\", \"combined_L1_L2_data.rds\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nCheck that your data are correctly imported by examining the output of `View(Dabrowska.data)` and `str(Dabrowska.data)`. Once you are satisfied that that's the case, we ready to get creative! 🎨\n\n## The syntax of graphics {#sec-Syntax}\n\nThe syntax of the Grammar of Graphics [@wilkinsonGrammarGraphics2005] is made up of **layers** (@fig-layers), which allow us to create highly effective and efficient data visualisations, while giving us lots of flexibility and control.\n\n![The syntax of the Grammar of Graphics as visualised in the [QCBS R Workshop Series](https://r.qcbs.ca/workshop03/book-en/grammar-of-graphics-gg-basics.html) (CC-BY-NC-SA).](images/gglayers.png){#fig-layers width=\"559\" fig-alt=\"A layered diagram illustrating the key elements of data visualization: Data, Aesthetics, Geometries, Facets, Statistics, Coordinates, and Theme, each shown as a layer with a distinct colour.\"}\n\nThe **data** layer and the **aesthetics** layer are compulsory as you cannot build a graph that does not map *some* data onto *some* visual aspect (= aesthetic) of a graph. The remaining layers are optional, but some are very important. In the following, we will explain how the **geometries**, **facet**, **scales**, **coordinates**, and **theme** layers are used to build and customise graphs using the {ggplot2} library in `R`.\n\n:::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n::: column-margin\n![Hex sticker of the [{ggplot2}](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package](images/hex_ggplot2.png){width=\"100\" fig-alt=\"The hexagonal logo of the ggplot2 package features a graph with dots that are connected by a line.\"}\n:::\n::::\n\n### Aesthetics {#sec-aes}\n\nAs explained in the documentation, the `ggplot()` function[^10_dataviz-1] has two compulsory arguments. First, we must select the **data** that we want to visualise. Second, we must specify which variable(s) from the data should be mapped onto which visual property or **aesthetics** (short: `aes`) of the plot.\n\n[^10_dataviz-1]: Note that, while the library is called {ggplot2}, its main function is called `ggplot()`.\n\n> |                  |                 |\n> |------------------|-----------------|\n> | ggplot {ggplot2} | R Documentation |\n>\n> ### Description {.unnumbered}\n>\n> `ggplot()` initializes a ggplot object. It can be used to declare the input data frame for a graphic and to specify the set of plot aesthetics intended to be common throughout all subsequent layers unless specifically overridden.\n>\n> ### Usage {.unnumbered}\n>\n> ```         \n> ggplot(data = NULL, mapping = aes(), ...)\n> ```\n\nFor example, to create a bar plot visualising the distribution of participants' occupational groups in the combined dataset from @DabrowskaExperienceAptitudeIndividual2019 (`Dabrowska.data`), we need to map the `OccupGroup` variable from `Dabrowska.data` onto our plot's *x-*axis (`x`).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = Dabrowska.data,\n       mapping = aes(x = OccupGroup))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Attempt to plot the distribution of participants' occupational groups in Dąbrowska (2019)](10_Dataviz_files/figure-html/fig-EmptyBarplot-1.png){#fig-EmptyBarplot fig-alt='An empty plot with the x-axis labeled OccupGroup and four group labels: C, I, M, and PS. No data is shown.' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs you can see from @fig-EmptyBarplot, however, running this code returns an empty plot: All we get is a grid background and a nicely labelled *x-*axis, but no data... Why might that be?  🤔\n\n### Geometries {#sec-geoms}\n\nThe reason we are not seeing any data is that we have not yet specified with which kind of **geometry** (short: **geom**) we would like to plot the data. The {ggplot2} library features more than 30 different geom functions! They all begin with the prefix `geom_`. To create a bar plot showing participants' occupational groups, we need to add a `geom_bar()` **layer** to our empty `ggplot` object (see @fig-barplot1).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = Dabrowska.data,\n       mapping = aes(x = OccupGroup)) +\n  geom_bar()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Distribution of participants' occupational groups (C = clerical position, I = inactive (i.e. unemployed, retired, or homemakers), M = manual jobs, PS = professional-level job or studying for a degree)](10_Dataviz_files/figure-html/fig-barplot1-1.png){#fig-barplot1 fig-alt='A bar plot showing the number of various occupational groups.

The y-axis represents the number of individuals in each group and is labeled as count.' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that we use the `+` operator to *add* layers to `ggplot` objects. If we try to use the pipe operator (`|>`) *within* the `ggplot()` function, we will get an error message.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = Dabrowska.data,\n       mapping = aes(x = OccupGroup)) |> \n  geom_bar()\n```\n:::\n\n\n```         \nError in `geom_bar()`: \n! `mapping` must be created by `aes()`. \nℹ Did you use `%>%` or `|>` instead of `+`? \nRun `rlang::last_trace()` to see where the error occurred.\n```\n\n### Statistics and labels {#sec-StatsLabs}\n\nWe now have a simple bar plot that represents the distribution of participants' occupational groups in @DabrowskaExperienceAptitudeIndividual2019. By default, the axis labels are simply the names of the variables that are mapped onto the plot's aesthetics. That's why, in @fig-barplot1, our *x*-axis is labelled \"OccupGroup\".\n\nWhat about the *y*-axis? We did not specify a *y*-aesthetic within the mapping argument of our `ggplot()` object, yet the *y*-axis is labelled \"count\". This is because `geom_bar()` automatically computes a \"count\" **statistic** that gets mapped to the *y*-aesthetic.\n\nIf we want to change these axis labels, we can do so by adding a `labs()` **layer** to our plot (see @fig-BarOccupGroup).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = Dabrowska.data,\n       mapping = aes(x = OccupGroup)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(x = \"Occupational group\",\n       y = \"Number of participants\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Distribution of participants' occupational groups (C = clerical position, I = inactive (i.e. unemployed, retired, or homemakers), M = manual jobs, PS = professional-level job or studying for a degree)](10_Dataviz_files/figure-html/fig-BarOccupGroup-1.png){#fig-BarOccupGroup fig-alt='This is the same bar plot as above.

Using a screenreader programme, blind and visually impaired individuals can have the alt-text associated with an image read out to them.\n\nA good alt-text aims to convey the main message and insights of the graph, allowing someone who cannot see it to understand the information being presented. In the context of online publications, alt-text is also useful in regions with low bandwidth as images may take a very long time to load. By including alt-text, we can therefore make our work more accessible and inclusive, enabling more people to engage with and understand our data and analyses.\n:::\n\n### Data {#sec-ggplotData}\n\nInstead of using the **data** argument of the `ggplot()` function as we did above, we can **pipe** the data into the function's first argument (see @sec-Piping). Compare these two methods and their outputs.\n\n:::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"48%\"}\n**Using the data argument of `ggplot()`**\n\n\n::: {.cell source-line-numbers='1'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = Dabrowska.data,\n       mapping = aes(x = OccupGroup))      +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(x = \"Occupational group\",\n       y = \"Number of participants\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](10_Dataviz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){fig-alt='This is the same bar plot as above.' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"4%\"}\n<!-- empty column to create gap -->\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"48%\"}\n**Piping the data into `ggplot()`**\n\n\n::: {.cell source-line-numbers='1'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nDabrowska.data |> \n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = OccupGroup)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(x = \"Occupational group\",\n       y = \"Number of participants\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](10_Dataviz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){fig-alt='This is the same bar plot as above.' width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n::::::\n\nThe outputs are exactly the same! Piping the dataset into the `ggplot()` function, however, allows us to easily wrangle the data that we want to visualise 'on the fly', without transforming the data object itself. For example, we can use the tidyverse `filter()` function (see @sec-filter) to examine the distribution of occupational groups among L2 participants only (see @fig-BarOccupGroupL2).\n\n\n::: {.cell source-line-numbers='2,7'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nDabrowska.data |> \n  filter(Group == \"L2\") |> \n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = OccupGroup)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(x = \"Occupational group\",\n       y = \"Number of participants\",\n       title = \"Occupational groups of L2 participants\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](10_Dataviz_files/figure-html/fig-BarOccupGroupL2-1.png){#fig-BarOccupGroupL2 fig-alt='Bar plot with the title of Occupational groups of L2 participants showing the distribution of L2 participants\\' occupational group.

For example, we may want to visualise the distribution of the occupational groups of participants who are L2 speakers of English *and* whose first language is Polish (see @fig-BarOccupGroupL2Polish).\n\n\n::: {.cell source-line-numbers='2,7'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nDabrowska.data |> \n  filter(Group == \"L2\" & NativeLg == \"Polish\") |> \n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = OccupGroup)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(x = \"Occupational group\",\n       y = \"Number of participants\",\n       title = \"Occupational groups of Polish L2 participants\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](10_Dataviz_files/figure-html/fig-BarOccupGroupL2Polish-1.png){#fig-BarOccupGroupL2Polish fig-alt='Bar plot showing the number of Polish L2 participants across occupational groups C, I, M, and PS, with M having the highest count.

In the following, we use the `facet_wrap()` function to subdivide our bar plot by the `Group` variable (`~ Group`). This allows us to easily compare the distribution of occupations across L1 and the L2 participants (see @fig-BarOccupGroupFacet).\n\n\n::: {.cell source-line-numbers='4'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nDabrowska.data |> \n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = OccupGroup)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_wrap(~ Group) +\n  labs(x = \"Occupational group\",\n       y = \"Number of participants\",\n       title = \"Occupational groups of participants\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](10_Dataviz_files/figure-html/fig-BarOccupGroupFacet-1.png){#fig-BarOccupGroupFacet fig-alt='Bar plot titled Occupational groups of participants showing the number of participants in four occupational groups for two categories, L1 and L2.

For example, to make our facetted plot in @fig-TwoFacetsBarplot easier to read, we could add some colour using a **fill** aesthetic to fill each bar with a colour that corresponds to the participants' gender. To do so, we map each unique value of the variable `Gender` (\"F\" and \"M\") onto a colour that is then used to fill the corresponding bars of our bar plot.

This is because, in the Grammar of Graphics, colour palettes are governed by **scales**. To specify a different set of colours, we therefore need to specify a **scale layer**.\n\nOne way to do this is to use `scale_fill_manual()` to manually pick our own colours, either using [`R` colour codes](https://r-charts.com/colors/) (such as `purple`) or [hexadecimal colour codes](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp) (such as `#34027d`).

After all, the two `gender` subgroups are already distinguished by the `facet_wrap()` layer. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but you must consider whether such redundant elements facilitate the interpretation of the data visualised or not.\n\nIn some cases, colour is used as the *only* way of identifying subgroups in the data, for example in a **stacked bar plot** (see @fig-ColourStackedBarplot).

To ensure that your data visualisations are accessible to as many people as possible, you may want to use the [{colorBlindness}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/colorBlindness/vignettes/colorBlindness.html) package [@ouColorBlindnessSafeColor2021] to simulate the appearance of a set of colours for people with different forms of colour blindness.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#install.packages(\"colorBlindness\")\nlibrary(colorBlindness)\n\ncolorBlindness::displayAllColors(scales::hue_pal()(6))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](10_Dataviz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nUsing the {colorBlindness} package, we can immediately see that the default {scales} discrete palette that {ggplot2} used in @fig-ColourBarplot is not accessible to colour blind people (deuteranope and protanope), nor is it distinguishable when printed in grey-scale (desaturate). In contrast, our hand-picked colours from @fig-PurpleBarplot fare much better.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncolorBlindness::displayAllColors(c(\"pink\", \"#34027d\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](10_Dataviz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBut you need not manually pick colours, as many people have developed and shared `R` packages that feature attractive, ready-to-use colour-blind friendly palettes. The [{viridis}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html) package [@garnierSjmgarnierViridisCRAN2023], for example, includes eight such palettes (\"magma\", \"inferno\", \"plasma\", \"cividis\", \"rocket\", \"turbo\") that also reproduce well in grey-scale.

Wordlwide, far more people are affected by **blindness** and **low vision**. @sec-LiteRateProgramming explains how to add **alternative texts** (alt-text) to plots and images. Many people with visual impairments rely on screen readers that use these alternative texts to provide audio descriptions of images and plots. These alternative texts can also improve the user experience when there are internet connection issues and images do not load properly or quickly enough.\n::::\n\nSome academic publishers still require grey-scale plots, in which case you will want to use the **scale** layer `scale_fill_grey()`. Alternatively, the colour palettes of the {viridis} package (see information box on colour blindness) render well in grey, too. The {viridis} function for a discrete colour scale (as needed for a categorical variable such as `Gender`) can be called up using the `scale_fill_viridis_d()` function. With the \"option\" argument, you can switch between eight different viridis palettes (\"magma\", \"inferno\", \"plasma\", \"cividis\", \"rocket\", \"turbo\").\n\n::: panel-tabset\n###### scale_fill_grey()\n\n\n::: {.cell source-line-numbers='9'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nDabrowska.data |> \n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = OccupGroup, fill = Gender)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_wrap(~ Group) +\n  labs(x = \"Occupational group\",\n       y = \"Participants\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0),\n                     limits = c(0,35)) +\n  scale_fill_grey()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](10_Dataviz_files/figure-html/fig-GreyBarplot-1.png){#fig-GreyBarplot width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n###### scale_fill_viridis_d\n\n\n::: {.cell source-line-numbers='9'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nDabrowska.data |> \n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = OccupGroup, fill = Gender)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_wrap(~ Group) +\n  labs(x = \"Occupational group\",\n       y = \"Participants\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0),\n                     limits = c(0,35)) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"viridis\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](10_Dataviz_files/figure-html/fig-ViridisBarplot-1.png){#fig-ViridisBarplot width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n###### scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"turbo\")\n\n\n::: {.cell source-line-numbers='9'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nDabrowska.data |> \n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = OccupGroup, fill = Gender)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_wrap(~ Group) +\n  labs(x = \"Occupational group\",\n       y = \"Participants\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0),\n                     limits = c(0,35)) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"turbo\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](10_Dataviz_files/figure-html/fig-ViridisTurboBarplot-1.png){#fig-ViridisTurboBarplot width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\nIf you like colours, check out the {paletteer} package [@hvitfeldtPaletteerComprehensiveCollection2021], which provides a neat interface to access a very large collection of `R` colour packages, some of which are very fun!

This means that the age range from 17 to 65 has been subdivided into 30 groups of equal size. Given that there is a range of 48 in the `Age` values in this dataset, this is not a great way to subdivide the values of this variable.\n\nAs indicated in the message, to change this behaviour, we can adjust the value of the \"binwidth\" argument. This argument determines how many years go in each bin. So if we choose to have two years in each subdivision of the `Age` variable, we will end up with 24 bins. Logically, if we decide to group four years in each subdivision of the `Age` variable, we will end up with just 12 bins.\n\nCompare the three histograms below.

These values are then called within the `geom_vline()` function, which draws vertical lines. In other words, in addition to setting `aes()` mappings within the main `ggplot()` function at the start of our plot code, we can also add **additional data mappings** within a specific `geom_` function. With all these options, it's no exaggeration to say that, if you really set your mind to, pretty much anything is possible with {ggplot2}! 🙃\n:::\n\n### Boxplots\n\nIn @sec-IQR, we saw that **boxplots** are a great way to visualise both the central tendency (median) of a numeric variable and the spread around this central tendency (IQR). There is an in-built function to create boxplots in {ggplot2}. No prizes will be awarded for guessing that the necessary `geom_` function is called... `geom_density()`! 😆\n\nWhilst it's possible to plot just a single boxplot, that rarely makes sense. In fact, the `x`-axis in @fig-GrammarBoxPlot is entirely nonsensical! The distribution of `Grammar` scores across the entire dataset is much better visualised as a histogram or density plot (see @sec-Density) than as a single boxplot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nDabrowska.data |>\n  ggplot(mapping = aes(y = Grammar)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(y = \"Grammar scores\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](10_Dataviz_files/figure-html/fig-GrammarBoxPlot-1.png){#fig-GrammarBoxPlot width=384}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf, however, we want to compare the `Grammar` scores of two or more different groups of participants, a boxplot makes a lot more sense (see @fig-GrammarBoxPlotGroup). To achieve this, we add a second argument within the `aes()` function, which maps the values of the `Group` variable (which are either \"L1\" or \"L2\") to the plot's `x`-axis.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nDabrowska.data |>\n  ggplot(mapping = aes(y = Grammar, \n                       x = Group)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(y = \"Grammar scores\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](10_Dataviz_files/figure-html/fig-GrammarBoxPlotGroup-1.png){#fig-GrammarBoxPlotGroup width=480}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe meaning conveyed by @fig-GrammarBoxPlotGroup is clear: there is hardly any difference between the average (median) grammar comprehension test scores of L1 and L2 participants in @DabrowskaExperienceAptitudeIndividual2019's dataset. Indeed, we can see that the thicker, middle lines within each boxplot are almost at the same level. However, the two boxplots have very different shapes and overall lengths: the scores of the 50% of L2 participants who scored below the median are much more spread out than those of the L1 participants who obtained below-average scores. This makes intuitive sense: native English speakers living in the UK who volunteer for such a study are likely to all have a fairly high to very high understanding of English grammar. By contrast, the L2 speakers are much more varied: some are highly proficient in English, while others are not.

They are best suited to continuous numeric variables.\n\nIn the following, we will build a scatter plot to explore the following hypothesis:\n\n-   In the data from @DabrowskaExperienceAptitudeIndividual2019, English grammar comprehension scores are more strongly associated with the level of formal education among L2 speakers than among L1 speakers.\n\nTo explore this hypothesis, we map the total number of years that participants spent in formal education (`EduTotal`) onto the *x*-axis and their `Grammar` scores onto the *y*-axis. In addition, we use the `facet_wrap()` function to split the data into two panels: one for the L1 participants and the other for the L2 group.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nDabrowska.data |> \n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = EduTotal, \n                     y = Grammar)) +\n  facet_wrap(~ Group) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(x = \"Number of years in formal education\",\n       y = \"Grammar comprehension test scores\",\n       title = \"Exploring hypothesis 1\") +\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](10_Dataviz_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-44-1.png){width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAt first glance, it would seem that our data do not support our initial hypothesis: among the L2 participants, there is no obvious trend suggesting that those who scored lowest on the grammar test were the ones who spent fewer years in formal education.-\n\nIn @fig-GrammarScatterPlot, we add a regression line (in blue) per panel to our facetted scatter plot using the `geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")` function. This allows us to visualise the **correlation** between participants' grammar scores and the number of years they spent in formal education.\n\n\n::: {.cell source-line-numbers='6-7'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nDabrowska.data |> \n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = EduTotal, \n                       y = Grammar)) +\n  facet_wrap(~ Group) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\",\n              se = FALSE) +\n  labs(x = \"Number of years in formal education\",\n       y = \"Grammar comprehension test scores\",\n       title = \"Exploring hypothesis 1\") +\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](10_Dataviz_files/figure-html/fig-GrammarScatterPlot-1.png){#fig-GrammarScatterPlot width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nRegression lines in scatter plots are interpreted as follows:\n\n-   If the regression line goes up, there is a **positive correlation** between the two numeric variables. ↗️\n-   If the line goes down, there is a **negative correlation**. ↘️\n-   The steeper the line, the stronger the correlation. 💪\n-   If the line is flat (or nearly flat), there is no (linear) correlation between the two variables. ➡️\n-   Be aware that even very strong correlations do not necessarily imply (direct) causation. ❌\n\nThe regression lines added by the `geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")` function are **lines of best fit**: the better the fit, the closer the points are to the line. If few points are on or close to the line, it means that the regression line is not a good approximation of the relationship between the two variables. This is clearly the case in @fig-GrammarScatterPlot - especially in the L2 panel (more on this in @sec-Correlations). Our data visualisation therefore do not support our hypothesis that, in the @DabrowskaExperienceAptitudeIndividual2019 data, grammar scores are more strongly associated with the level of formal education among the L2 speakers than among the L1 speakers. If anything, our data show the opposite pattern! Our line of fit is both closer to the data points and steeper in the L1 panel than in the L2 panel.\n\nSo far, all of our data visualisations have only displayed the characteristics of the collected data. In other words, they display **descriptive statistics** (see @sec-DescRiptiveStats) that do not allow us to make inferences about other participants who were not tested as part of @DabrowskaExperienceAptitudeIndividual2019's study.

In this exploratory analysis, we will therefore focus on female participants who obtained fewer than 90 points on the test.\n\n\n::: {.cell source-line-numbers='3,13'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"See `R` code.\"}\nDabrowska.data |> \n  filter(Group == \"L2\") |> \n  filter(Grammar < 90 & Gender == \"F\") |> \nggplot(aes(x = Age, \n           y = Grammar,\n           colour = NativeLgFamily,\n           label = NativeLg)) +\n  geom_text() +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(15,55)) +\n  labs(x = \"Age\", \n       y = \"Grammar comprehension test score\", \n       color = \"Language family\",\n       caption = \"(Subgroup analysis of female L2 participants with grammar scores below 90.)\") +\n  theme_bw(base_size = 14)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](10_Dataviz_files/figure-html/fig-TextScatterPlot2-1.png){#fig-TextScatterPlot2 width=768}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that we had to expand the limits of the *x*-axis in order for labels of the youngest and oldest participants to be displayed in full on @fig-TextScatterPlot2.

In other words, simpler plots are often more effective than complex ones.

{.content-visible when-format=\"pdf\"}\n![](images/IntPlotCh10b.png)\n:::\n\n## Exporting plots 🚀 {#sec-ExploringPlots}\n\nYou may want to share the plots that you have created in `R` with others or insert them in a research paper or presentation. {ggplot2} provides a convenient way to export plots in various formats using the `ggsave()` function. You can specify the file name, format, and other options such as the width, height, and resolution of the image.\n\nIf you run the `ggsave()` function without specifying which plot should be saved, it will save the last plot that was displayed. The image file type is determined by the extension of the file name that you provide, e.g. a file name ending in `.png` will export your graph to a PNG file. You can specify its dimensions in centimetres (`cm`), millimetres (`mm`), inches (`in`), and pixel (`px`). Working out appropriate dimensions can be tricky and typically requires a bit of experimenting until you get it right.\n\n\n::: {.cell source-line-numbers='9-12'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nDabrowska.data |> \n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Blocks,\n                       fill = Group)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.7) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d() +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0),\n                     limits = c(0,30)) +\n  labs(x = \"Non-verbal IQ (Blocks test)\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nggsave(\"BlocksDensityPlot.png\",\n       width = 10,\n       height = 8,\n       units = \"cm\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nBy default, plots will be exported to the project's working directory. You can save it elsewhere by specifying a different file path (see @sec-FoldersPaths). For example, this function will save the last plot displayed as an SVG file in the project's subfolder \"figures\". Note that, if the subfolder to which you want to save your graph does not yet exist, `R` will return an error. So make sure that the subfolder exists at the path that you specified before attempting to save anything in it!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggsave(\"figures/BlocksDensityPlot.svg\",\n       width = 1500,\n       height = 1000,\n       units = \"px\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Check your progress 🌟 {.unnumbered}\n\nWell done!

But you should know that the possibilities with `R`, the {ggplot2} library, and its many extensions are pretty much limitless: The [`R` Graph Gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/) lists some 50 different types of charts with over 400 examples with code! Another great resource is [The R Graphics Cookbook](https://r-graphics.org) by Winston Chang. To go beyond the basics and to find out more information about the theoretical underpinnings of the {ggplot2} package, I recommend [ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](https://ggplot2-book.org). There are also great `R` packages to produce more specialised types of graphs frequently used in linguistics such as [vowel charts](https://joeystanley.com/blog/making-vowel-plots-in-r-part-1/) and [dialectal maps](https://doi.org/10.1017/jlg.2024.11) (see list of [next-step resources](https://elenlefoll.github.io/RstatsTextbook/A_FurtherResources.html)).\n:::\n",
