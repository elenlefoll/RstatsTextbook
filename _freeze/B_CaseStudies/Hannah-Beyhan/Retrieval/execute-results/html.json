After completing her first bachelor's degree in social work in Regensburg, and mostly working in the field of social services, she studied linguistics and German studies at the University of Cologne, where she focused on metaphor studies and corpus linguistics. She has now additionally taken an interest to computational linguistics within the specialization of her master's.\n\n**Beyhan Aliy** is a first-year master's student in linguistics at the University of Cologne, where she specializes in psycho- and neurolinguistics. She also completed her bachelor's degree in linguistics and English studies at the University of Cologne. She is currently working as a student assistant at the Department of Linguistics.\n\nThe authors made equal contributions to the chapter. An earlier version of this chapter was submitted as a term paper for Elen Le Foll's M.A. seminar \"Introduction to Data Analysis in `R` for linguists and language education scholars\" (University of Cologne, summer 2025). Elen supervised the project, provided feedback, and contributed to the present revised version of this chapter.\n:::\n\n# Chapter overview {.unnumbered}\n\nThis chapter aims to reproduce the analyses published in:\n\n> Terai, Masato, Junko Yamashita, and Kelly E. Pasich. 2021. EFFECTS OF LEARNING DIRECTION IN RETRIEVAL PRACTICE ON EFL VOCABULARY LEARNING. Studies in Second Language Acquisition 43(5): 1116–1137. <https://doi.org/10.1017/S0272263121000346>.\n\nBased on the original data from @2021, we show how `R` can be used in Second Language Acquisition (SLA) research. This chapter will walk you through how to:\n\n-   Retrieve the authors' original data and import it in `R`\n-   Calculate descriptive statistics concerning target items, test types, and alpha coefficients for tests\n-   Reproduce Tables 3, 4 and 5 from @2021\n-   Fit a generalized linear mixed-effects model to investigate the effectiveness of learning direction\n-   Compare models with and without interactions\n-   Fit a generalized linear mixed-effects model to explore the influence of L2 proficiency on the two types of learning\n-   Interpret and compare the results with those published in @2021\n-   Visualize the results with different kinds of plots to facilitate interpretation\n\nBy the end of this chapter, you will have experience of fitting and interpreting mixed-effects logistics regression models in `R` on experimental data.\n\n# Introducing the study\n\nIn this chapter, we attempt to reproduce the results of an SLA study by @2021. The study focuses on learning directions in pair-associated vocabulary learning: L2 to L1, where L2 words are used as stimuli and responses are given in L1 vs. L1 to L2, where it is the other way around. As opposed to studying practices where both a target and the answer are simultaneously presented, pair-associated learning involves *retrieval*. Retrieval is defined as the process of accessing stored information and plays a crucial role in retaining a learned word in memory [@2021: 1116-1117]. Previous findings regarding the efficacy of the two types of learning directions had been inconsistent. The study that we will reproduce focuses on the relationship between L2 proficiency and the effectiveness of the two learning directions in paired-associate learning in L2 vocabulary acquisition. It aims to answer two research questions:\n\n1.  Which learning direction is more effective for vocabulary acquisition, L1 to L2 learning or L2 to L1 learning?\n2.  How does L2 proficiency influence the effects of L2 to L1 and L1 to L2 learning?\n\nTo answer these questions, @2021 designed an experiment in which Japanese EFL (English as a Foreign Language) learners studied word pairs and then completed retrieval practice tasks in different conditions. After learning, students were tested on their ability to produce the target vocabulary items in both Japanese (their L1) and English (their L2). @2021 formulated two hypotheses:\n\n1.  There is no significant difference between the two learning directions.\n2.  The effect of the learning direction depends on the learner’s L2 proficiency [@2021: 1121-1122].\n\n# Retrieving the original data\n\nWe will use the study's original data for our reproduction, which the authors have made openly accessible on [IRIS](https://www.iris-database.org/search/?s_publicationAPAInlineReference=Terai%20et%20al.%20(2021)), an open-access database for language research data and materials.\n\nNot only have the authors made their research data available, they have also shared their `R` code. Our reproduction will examine and run this `R` code to investigate and interpret the statistical analyses and results presented in the original publication.\n\nThe dataset (`dataset1_ssla_20210313.csv`) contains data for each participant and item, including the following key variables:\n\n-   **Answer** (whether the participant gave the correct answer (1 = correct, 0 = incorrect))\n-   **Test** (distinguishing the two test types: L1 Production and L2 Production)\n-   **Condition** (distinguishing the two learning directions: L2 -\\> L1 or L1 -\\> L2)\n\nBut more on that later.\n\n# Set-up and Data import\n\nBefore importing the dataset and starting on our project, we need to load all the packages that we will need. You may have to first install some of these packages using the `install.packages()` command in your console.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(here) \nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNext, we import the data. In contrast to @2021's code, we used the {here} package for importing the data. This package creates paths relative to the top-level directory and therefore makes it easier to reference files in a reproducible manner (see @sec-ImportingDataCSV).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nVocabularyA_L1production <- read.csv(file = here(\"B_CaseStudies\", \"Hannah-Beyhan\", \"data\", \"vocaA_L1pro_20210313.csv\"))\nVocabularyA_L2production <- read.csv(file = here(\"B_CaseStudies\", \"Hannah-Beyhan\", \"data\", \"vocaA_L2pro_20210313.csv\"))\nVocabularyB_L1production <- read.csv(file = here(\"B_CaseStudies\", \"Hannah-Beyhan\", \"data\", \"vocaB_L1pro_20210313.csv\"))\nVocabularyB_L2production <- read.csv(file = here(\"B_CaseStudies\", \"Hannah-Beyhan\", \"data\", \"vocaB_L2pro_20210313.csv\"))\n\n# Loading the dataset\ndat <- read.csv(file = here(\"B_CaseStudies\", \"Hannah-Beyhan\", \"data\", \"dataset1_ssla_20210313.csv\"), header=T)\n```\n:::\n\n\nAs already mentioned, the dataset contains different information on items and participants. The other four files contain the vocabulary scores for each item, for both L1 and L2 production tests and both Vocabulary A and Vocabulary B items. Every cell contains either 1 (correct) or 0 (incorrect).\n\n# Descriptive statistics\n\nBefore we dive into the descriptive statistics conducted in @2021, we need to explain that one part of it will not be reproduced. While descriptive statistics about the participants (age, years of learning, etc.) are mentioned in the original paper [@2021: 1122-1123], we were not able to find the data to reproduce these findings. That said, it is common for participant data not to be shared to protect their identities. Therefore, in this section, we will focus on reproducing the descriptive statistics of the target items (40 English words used in the study), test types and reliability testing. We'll start with the target items, which are found in Table 3 in the paper [@2021: 1123].\n\nMost of the numbers reproduced here are statistics already introduced in the textbook: mean, median, maximum and minimum, as well as the standard deviation (SD) (see @sec-DescRiptiveStats). In addition, @2021 report skewness and kurtosis. **Skewness** and **kurtosis** are both measures of the shape and distribution of a variable. Skewness measures the asymmetry of a distribution. Simply put, skewness describes the proportion of a distribution which differs from a completely symmetrical shape [@2023]:\n\n-   Skew = 0 -\\> perfectly symmetrical.\n-   Negative Skew -\\> longer \"tail\" on the left.\n-   Positive Skew -\\> longer \"tail\" on the right.\n\nKurtosis is a measure of peaks of a distribution. Basically, it is a description of how the peaks compare to a normal distribution [@2023]:\n\n-   Kurtosis = 0 -\\> similar to a normal distribution.\n-   Positive kurtosis -\\> sharper peak (more concentrated in the center).\n-   Negative kurtosis -\\> flatter peak. [@2023]\n\n## Reproduction of Table 3\n\nIn this section, our aim is to reproduce Table 3 from @2021: 1123, which displays the descriptive statistics of the target items of the study. Unfortunately, the code for all the tables shown in @2021 was not included in the shared `R` code. But as we have the data in the form of a `.csv` file, this is not a problem! We have the organized data ready for us to analyze. Thus, we will learn how to reproduce the data of Table 3 step-by-step.\n\nIn the following chunk, we load some necessary libraries and use the `trimws()` function, which removes space from the beginning and end of the text. This helps to prevent issues like \"berth \" vs. \"berth\" being treated as two different word forms.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load libraries (packages need to first be installed, if they aren't already)\n\nlibrary(moments) #for skewness and kurtosis\nlibrary(knitr) #for nice tables\nlibrary(kableExtra) #for nicer tables\n\ndat$ItemID <- trimws(dat$ItemID)\n```\n:::\n\n\nIn the paper by @2021 we can see that the variables for the English (**L2-related variables**) words they used are: Frequency, Syllables, and Letters. For Japanese (**L1-related variables**): Frequency, Letters, and Mora (syllables) as well as Familiarity (Fami A). Fami (A) refers to familiarity ratings taken from the large database by @2000 as the authors explain [@2021: 1123]. These ratings showed how familiar each Japanese word is to the general population. The second familiarity ratings (Fami (B)), represents the participants' own familiarity ratings collected for this study. We were not able to reproduce Fami (B) as the data was not made public.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-descriptives .cell tbl-cap='Description of the Dataset Variables'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the `R` code to generate the table below.\"}\nvar_info <- data.frame(\n  Column = c(\"ItemID\", \"L2Frequency\", \"Syllables\", \"Alphabet\", \"L1Frequency\", \"WordLength\", \"mora\", \"Familiarity\"),\n  Description = c(\n    \"English target word (40 items)\",\n    \"Frequency of the word in English (COCA: Corpus of Contemporary American English)\",\n    \"Number of syllables in the English word\",\n    \"Number of letters in the English word ('Letters' in the L2 table)\",\n    \"Frequency of the word in Japanese (Amano & Kondo, 1999)\",\n    \"Number of letters in the Japanese orthographic form\",\n    \"Number of mora (Japanese syllable-like units)\",\n    \"Participants Familiarity ratings from current study (Fami (B))\"\n  )\n)\n\nkable(var_info) %>%\n  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = \"center\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Column </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Description </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> ItemID </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> English target word (40 items) </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> L2Frequency </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Frequency of the word in English (COCA: Corpus of Contemporary American English) </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Syllables </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Number of syllables in the English word </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Alphabet </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Number of letters in the English word ('Letters' in the L2 table) </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> L1Frequency </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Frequency of the word in Japanese (Amano &amp; Kondo, 1999) </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> WordLength </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Number of letters in the Japanese orthographic form </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> mora </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Number of mora (Japanese syllable-like units) </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Familiarity </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Participants Familiarity ratings from current study (Fami (B)) </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBasically, what we are doing next is reshaping our data from participant-focused to item-focused. The raw dataset has multiple rows per word because each participant contributed several responses and thus has their own row per word. For example, the word \"weasel\" appears many times, once for each participant. But to compute descriptive statistics of the items, we only want one row per word.\n\nTo solve this issue we use the functions `group_by()` and `summarise()` to turn all those rows into just a single one per word. With `group_by(ItemID)`, we group all rows together that contain the same word. Combining the `summarise()` and `first()` functions then creates our new dataset by keeping only the first mention of each word's frequency, number of syllables, etc. Only for the familiarity ratings do we calculate the `mean()` across all participants as word familiarity differs across the participants. The last argument `.groups = \"drop\"` removes the grouping structure so that the resulting dataset is no longer grouped by ItemID.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nitems <- dat |>\n  group_by(ItemID) |>\n  summarise(\n    L2Frequency = first(L2Frequency),\n    Syllables = first(Syllables),\n    Alphabet = first(Alphabet),\n    L1Frequency = first(L1Frequency),\n    WordLength = first(WordLength),\n    mora = first(mora),\n    familiarity = mean(familiarity, na.rm = TRUE), \n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe want to do a quick check before we continue: Did we correctly import all 40 target words from the study [as described in @2021: 1123] into our items dataframe?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnrow(items)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 40\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWith this command we can also see what kind of words the authors were examining:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(items, 5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 5 × 8\n  ItemID L2Frequency Syllables Alphabet L1Frequency WordLength  mora familiarity\n  <chr>        <int>     <int>    <int>       <int>      <int> <int>       <dbl>\n1 alcove         932         2        6         178          4     4        5.53\n2 azalea         450         3        6         230          3     3        5.81\n3 badger         818         2        6           6          4     4        3.94\n4 berth         1851         1        5         245          4     4        5.53\n5 billow         231         2        6         362          4     4        5.16\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn order to avoid repeating code (and because we are lazy), we created our own function that computes all the descriptive statistics (mean, SD, median, min, max, skew, kurtosis) we need for each variable. We write our own function to do so (which you can think of as a \"small machine\") that we will name `quick_stats()` and that will do the calculations for us. `quick_stats <- funcion(x)` creates this function with the input 'x' which represents whichever variable we want to analyze. Inside of our function, we use `data.frame()` to organize our statistics before we begin the calculations. Each function within our function takes our input variable 'x' and computes the statistics. The functions `skewness()` and `kurtosis()` come from the {moments} package that we loaded earlier.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nquick_stats <- function(x) {\n  data.frame(\n    Mean = mean(x, na.rm = TRUE),\n    SD = sd(x, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Median = median(x, na.rm = TRUE), \n    Minimum = min(x, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Maximum = max(x, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Skew = moments::skewness(x, na.rm = TRUE),\n    Kurtosis = moments::kurtosis(x, na.rm = TRUE)\n    )\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow that we have most of what we need for the tables, we can start to build them up! We need to create two subtables.\n\nThe code below does this with two important functions: `rbind()` which stacks the rows we want to create on top of each other to build the final table which we will print in the next step. And `cbind()` which creates columns that stick together side by side. For example `cbind(Variable = \"Frequency\", desc(items$L2Frequency)` creates a column with the name \"Variable\" with the value \"Frequency\" next to the summary of the output of `quick_stats()`. With our helper function `desc()` we then insert the statistics from our data, in this case it is the \"L2Frequency\". Basically, we are creating here three rows stacked on top of each other for tab_L2, and four rows for tab_L1. As you see we only have to run our helper function `quick_stats()` seven times!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntab_L2 <- rbind(\n  cbind(Variable = \"Frequency\", quick_stats(items$L2Frequency)),\n  cbind(Variable = \"Syllables\", quick_stats(items$Syllables)),\n  cbind(Variable = \"Letters\", quick_stats(items$Alphabet))\n)\n\ntab_L1 <- rbind(\n  cbind(Variable = \"Frequency\", quick_stats(items$L1Frequency)),\n  cbind(Variable = \"Letters\", quick_stats(items$WordLength)),\n  cbind(Variable = \"Mora (syllables)\", quick_stats(items$mora)),\n  cbind(Variable = \"Fami (A)\", quick_stats(items$familiarity))\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nPerfect, the next and easiest part of building up our two subtables is captioning them and then finally printing them. Here we need the `kable()` and the `kable_classic()` function. We use these functions to make the tables look easy to read. The `kable()` function is quite nice because it helps to make the `R` code output look a little more professional. The function comes from the {knitr} package. `kable(tab_L2, ...)` takes our tab_2 data frame and converts it into a formatted table which we then caption with the argument `caption = \"...\"`. With the argument `align = \"lrrrrrr\"` we control the way the text is aligned in each column. the 'l' means left-aligned, while every added \"r\" means the remaining columns should be right-aligned. With the argument `digits = 2` we display all numeric values to a maximum of two decimal places.\n\nThe `kable_classics()` function comes from the {kableExtra} package we loaded earlier. It is also another function to tidy up our table style. The command `full_width = FALSE` makes sure that the table does not stretch too wide. When you run this code, you will see a nice table with clear structure and formatting which will make it easier to read and interpret, it also looks ready to be published.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-desc-stats1 .cell tbl-cap='Table 3a.

The L2 frequency has a mean of about **1025** with a quite large SD (\\~852), which shows us that some English words were quite frequent while others were much rarer. The skewness is positive (\\~1.51), although slightly different than the one reported in the paper (\\~1.57). The difference is only small and still shows that the distribution has a \"long tail\" of very high-frequency words. English words are, on average, 2 syllables, and range from 1 to 5 syllables with only a slight positive skewness which means that most words are short and only a few are longer. Again we note a small difference in our skewness metric compared to the one reported in the original study. On average, words are 6.2 letters long, again with a positive skewness. For the L1 variables, the frequency distribution also shows a strong positive skew, which means that few Japanese words are very common, but many are quite rare. Fami (A) averages about 5.2 on a 7-point scale, with a pretty low SD, suggesting that the words were mostly familiar, meaning participants generally recognized these Japanese words easily.\n\nOur skewness values match the original paper fairly closely, with only small differences. However, our kurtosis values differ quite a lot from the published results. This may seem like a huge issue at first, but is actually quite normal. Kurtosis calculations can vary between packages, for example the {moments} package we used calculates excess kurtosis, while the authors of the original paper might have used a different method. We tried several methods to reproduce the kurtosis values from the original publication, but failed to produce the values reported in the original study. We calculated both the excess kurtosis and the pearson kurtosis (see code chunk below), but no numbers match the ones in the paper.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Instead of mora any other variable of Table 3 can be added to calculate kurtosis\nexcess_kurt <- kurtosis(dat$mora, na.rm = TRUE) \npearson_kurt <- excess_kurt + 3\nround(c(excess = excess_kurt, pearson = pearson_kurt), 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n excess pearson \n  4.285   7.285 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere are several possibilities why this is the case. There might be an outlier that may have been removed, or maybe the authors used another method. The issue with the differences in our numbers and the ones by @2021 is that the differences are so big the graphs are going to look quite different, especially for the Fami (A) variable. In the original paper, the kurtosis shows -0.02 which would be a slightly flatter graph, while our kurtosis number 4.29 would be sharper. This is why, in an extension, we have added some graphs to show the importance of skewness and kurtosis and what exactly these numbers show.\n\n::: callout-note\n### Extension: Visualizations of Table 3 {.unnumbered}\n\n**Table 3** from the original study displays a summary of many descriptive statistics (mean, SD, range, skewness, kurtosis) for the 40 target words, but these numbers are much easier to understand when they are visualized. Below we want to turn some key variables of Table 3 into quick histograms to visually connect the ideas of skewness and kurtosis to the actual items used in this study.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# The {tidyverse} library needs to be loaded if you have not done it before.\n\nitems <- dat |>\n  group_by(ItemID) |>\n  summarise(\n    L2Frequency  = first(L2Frequency),\n    Syllables    = first(Syllables),\n    Letters_L2   = first(Alphabet),\n    L1Frequency  = first(L1Frequency),\n    Letters_L1   = first(WordLength),\n    Mora         = first(mora),\n    Familiarity  = mean(familiarity, na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe will start with a graph of L2 Frequencies. To do this we use the `ggplot()` command. The first line of code here `ggplot(data = items, aes(x = L2Frequency))` tells ggplot to basically use the \"items\" dataset and put the L2 frequencies of each word onto the x-axis. `geom_density(...)` creates the actual density plot. To fully understand where the numbers in the table come from, we add reference lines: `geom_vline(xintercept = mean(...))` for the mean value, and `geom_vline(xintercept = median(...), linetype = \"dashed\"...)` for a dashed line at the median.\n\nDo not be too confused by the numbers on the *y*-axis. The values can be read as a kind of probability, a higher peak means more words are around that frequency, while a lower peak means fewer words around that frequency.\n\n\n::: {.cell .fig-cap-location-bottom}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(items, aes(x = L2Frequency)) +\n  geom_density(fill = \"lightblue\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(items$L2Frequency), linewidth = 0.7) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = median(items$L2Frequency), linetype = \"dashed\", linewidth = 0.7) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  labs(x = \"L2 frequency (COCA)\",\n       y = \"Probability\") +\ntheme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Distribution of L2 word frequencies used in the study](Retrieval_files/figure-html/fig-plot1-1.png){#fig-plot1 width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn @fig-plot1 we can clearly see a right-skewed distribution which we saw in the table with the positive skewness values (\\~1.51). As you may recall, a normally distributed graph would look like a symmetric bell curve. By contrast, here, we see that most words have lower or medium frequency with only a few really high-frequency words (see the long right tail). The mean sits to the right of the median which is another characteristic of positive skew. Our kurtosis value (\\~5.21) shows us the sharpness or peakedness of our curve which you can see quite nicely when you compare the graph for L2 frequency to the one for L1 frequency (see @fig-plot2).\n\n\n::: {.cell .fig-cap-location-bottom}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(items, aes(x = L1Frequency)) +\n  geom_density(fill = \"lightblue\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(items$L1Frequency), linewidth = 0.7) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = median(items$L1Frequency), linetype = \"dashed\", linewidth = 0.7) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  labs(x = \"L1 frequency\",\n       y = \"Probability\",\n       caption = \"Solid line = mean; dashed line = median\") +\ntheme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Distribution of L1 word frequencies used in the study](Retrieval_files/figure-html/fig-plot2-1.png){#fig-plot2 width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n@fig-plot2 shows that a right-skew that is even stronger than for L2 word frequencies (skew \\~3.59). This shows once again that most words are lower-frequency, there are only very few high-frequency words. Here, with a kurtosis value of \\~18.10 we can see that with higher positive numbers the peak becomes sharper and sharper.\n:::\n\n## Descriptive statistics of the tests and reliability testing\n\nIn this section, we will attempt to reproduce the authors' descriptive statistics regarding the two types of post-tests and calculate Cronbach's α to estimate their reliability.\n\n### Reliability analysis\n\nTo conduct reliability analysis, the {psych} package needs to be installed and loaded.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(psych)\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo calculate Cronbach's α, @2021 applied the `alpha()` function to the vocabulary scores of both **the L1 and L2 production sets**. Below, we only show the code of the reliability analysis for Vocabulary A scores of the L1 production dataset, as an example:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nalpha(VocabularyA_L1production[,-1], warnings=FALSE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show code for reliability analysis for the rest of the dataset\"}\n# Vocabulary A (L2 production)\n\nalpha(VocabularyA_L2production[,-1], warnings = FALSE)\n\n# Vocabulary B (L1 production)\n\nalpha(VocabularyB_L1production[,-1], warnings = FALSE)\n\n# Vocabulary B (L2 production)\n\nalpha(VocabularyB_L2production[,-1], warnings = FALSE)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThese reliability analyses compute Cronbach’s α, a measure of internal consistency of tests. This measure indicates whether responses are consistent across items. Before interpreting these results, we will get to the descriptive statistics of the two types of post-tests.\n\n### Accuracy\n\nTo investigate accuracy, @2021 processed the collected results for each participant — their ID, how many items they answered, and how many they got right — and visualized them in a boxplot. In the original code, the authors loaded the dataset for this section again and stored it under a different object name `dat.acc`. We skipped that step and simply used `dat` instead as it is already available as an `R` object in our local environment.\n\nThe following code chunk, which analyses data pertaining to L2 -\\> L1 direction of the L1 production set, processes the results for each participant — their ID, answered items, correct answers — and puts them into a clean table. Therefore, it gives us the core numbers necessary to describe and analyze learners' vocabularly retrieval accuracy.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# L2 → L1 (L1 production test)\n\nz <- unique(dat$ID)\n\nScore <- c()\nIDes <- c()\ntry <- c()\n\nfor (i in z){\n  dat |> \n    dplyr::filter(ID == i, Condition == \"L2L1\", Test == \"L1 Production\") |> \n    dplyr::select(Answer) -> acc_recT\n  a <- as.vector(unlist(acc_recT))\n  b <- sum(a)\n  c <- length(a)\n  Score <- c(Score, b)\n  IDes <- c(IDes, i)\n  try <- c(try, c)\n}\n\naccu_L2L1_L1Pro <- data.frame(IDes, try, Score)\nnames(accu_L2L1_L1Pro) <- c(\"ID\", \"Try\", \"Score\")\naccu_L2L1_L1Pro\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe want to take the time to explain this code chunk in detail. The first line takes unique IDs from `dat` and saves it as `z`, `z` therefore being a vector of unique IDs. This part was slightly changed in comparison to @2021's code, which used three lines of code for this step. Further, a `for` loop is used to iterate over elements of this vector and assigning the IDs to the variable `i`. Inside this loop, for each `i` (a unique ID) the data is filtered for that participant under certain conditions, and then the Answer column is selected. The result is stored as the object `acc_recT`, which is further converted into a vector `a`. With `b` and `c`, the processed answers are computed and lastly, these results are appended into three vectors: `Score`, `IDes`, and `try`. These three vectors are combined into a final data frame `accu_L2L1_L1Pro`, where each vector becomes a column in a table, each row corresponding to one participant. These columns are renamed and the table is printed. If we want to properly see the table outside of the console, we can use the `View()` function:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nView(accu_L2L1_L1Pro)\n```\n:::\n\n\nFor L1 -\\> L2 of the L1 production set, we follow the same steps.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show code for L1 -> L2 (L1 production test)\"}\n# L1 → L2 (L1 production test)\n\nz <- unique(dat$ID)\n\nScore <- c()\nIDes <- c()\ntry <- c()\nfor (i in z){\n  dat |> \n    dplyr::filter(ID == i, Condition ==\"L1L2\", Test == \"L1 Production\") |> \n    dplyr::select(Answer)-> acc_recT\n  a <- as.vector(unlist(acc_recT))\n  b <- sum(a)\n  c <- length(a)\n  Score <- c(Score, b)\n  IDes <- c(IDes, i)\n  try <- c(try, c)\n}\n\naccu_L1L2_L1Pro <- data.frame(IDes, try, Score)\nnames(accu_L1L2_L1Pro) <- c(\"ID\", \"Try\", \"Score\")\naccu_L1L2_L1Pro\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhile accuracy did not play a very big role in the published paper, the authors did a bit more with it in their code. Aside from using the `describe()` function on the final data frames, which returns a rich set of descriptive statistics, they visualized the results in a boxplot. Since we found them to be quite nice for understanding the descriptive statistics of the tests, we decided to include these in this chapter, too.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show use of `describe()` function on `Score` column to provide descriptive statistics for L1 production\"}\n# L2 → L1 learning\ndescribe(accu_L2L1_L1Pro$Score)\n\n# L1 → L2 learning\ndescribe(accu_L1L2_L1Pro$Score)\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo visualize descriptive statistics for the L1 production set, the authors generated boxplots comparing the two learning directions. For this to work, the {beeswarm} package has to be installed and loaded. The authors assigned a data frame `L1pro` that contains the scores from both learning directions in the L1 production test. After changing the names of the columns to how they shall appear on the *x*-axis, the authors created a side-by-side boxplot for the two learning conditions. Finally, they added the `beeswarm()` function specifying `add = T`, which lets individual scores appear as jittered dots so that they don't overlap.\n\n\n::: {.cell .fig-cap-location-bottom}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Plot (L1 production)\n\nlibrary(beeswarm)\n\nL1pro <- data.frame(accu_L2L1_L1Pro$Score, accu_L1L2_L1Pro$Score)\nnames(L1pro) <- c(\"L2 → L1 learning\", \"L1 → L2 learning\")\nboxplot(L1pro, col = \"grey91\", outline = T)\nbeeswarm(L1pro, add = T)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![L1 Production Test scores across the two learning directions](Retrieval_files/figure-html/fig-L1-prod-1.png){#fig-L1-prod width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBoxplots are a way to visualize both the central tendency (median) of a variable and the spread around this central tendency (IQR) (see @sec-IQR). The median is represented by the thick line inside the box, while the box represents interquartile range, meaning the range of the middle 50% of the data. The whiskers outside the box extend to the highest and smallest values, and the jittered dots represent **individual data points**. As we can see here, the median is similar in both learning directions. **L2 → L1** displays slightly greater variability and a higher concentration of upper outliers. Overall, performance appears comparable between the two groups.\n\nThe same steps were applied to the L2 production set, using the L2 scores.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show code for L2 → L1 (L2 production test)\"}\n# L2 → L1 (L2 production test)\n\nz <- unique(dat$ID)\n\nScore <- c()\nIDes <- c()\ntry <- c()\nfor (i in z){\n  dat |> \n    dplyr::filter(ID == i, Condition == \"L2L1\", Test == \"L2 Production\") |> \n    dplyr::select(Answer) -> acc_proT\n  a <- as.vector(unlist(acc_proT))\n  b <- sum(a)\n  c <- length(a)\n  Score <- c(Score, b)\n  IDes <- c(IDes, i)\n  try <- c(try, c)\n}\n\naccu_L2L1_L2Pro <- data.frame(IDes, try, Score)\nnames(accu_L2L1_L2Pro) <- c(\"ID\", \"Try\", \"Score\")\naccu_L2L1_L2Pro\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show code for L1 → L2 (L2 production test)\"}\n# L1 → L2 (L2 production test)\n\nz <- unique(dat$ID)\n\nScore <- c()\nIDes <- c()\ntry <- c()\nfor (i in z){\n  dat |> \n    dplyr::filter(ID == i, Condition == \"L1L2\", Test == \"L2 Production\") |> \n    dplyr::select(Answer)-> acc_proT\n  a <- as.vector(unlist(acc_proT))\n  b <- sum(a)\n  c <- length(a)\n  Score <- c(Score, b)\n  IDes <- c(IDes, i)\n  try <- c(try, c)\n}\n\naccu_L1L2_L2Pro <- data.frame(IDes,try, Score)\nnames(accu_L1L2_L2Pro) <- c(\"ID\", \"Try\", \"Score\")\naccu_L1L2_L2Pro\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show use of `describe()` function on `Score` column to provide descriptive statistics for L2 production\"}\n# L2 -> L1 learning\n\ndescribe(accu_L2L1_L2Pro$Score)\n\n# L1 -> L2 learning\n\ndescribe(accu_L1L2_L2Pro$Score)\n```\n:::\n\n\n**As with L1,** @2021 created a similar boxplot comparing the two learning directions in L2 production using the beeswarm package.\n\n\n::: {.cell .fig-cap-location-bottom}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show R code to generate boxplots\"}\n# Plot (L2 production)\n\nL2pro <- data.frame(accu_L2L1_L2Pro$Score, accu_L1L2_L2Pro$Score)\nnames(L2pro) <- c(\"L2 → L1 learning\", \"L1 → L2 learning\")\nboxplot(L2pro, col = \"grey91\", outline = T)\nbeeswarm(L2pro, add = T)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![L2 Production Test scores across the two learning directions](Retrieval_files/figure-html/fig-L2-prod-1.png){#fig-L2-prod width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nMedian scores in the L2 production test are similar for both learning directions (L2 → L1 and L1 → L2), suggesting comparable performance in both groups. L1 → L2 learning shows a slightly higher median. In the L2 → L1 group, values below the median are more spread out, indicating more variety. Comparing the L1 and L2 production tests, L1 production scores appear to be generally higher and more consistent across both learning directions.\n\n### Reproducing Table 4 and 5\n\nAfter conducting reliability testing and descriptive statistics for the tests, we want to display the results in tables like Tables 4 and 5 from the original publication [@2021: 1126]. As with the target items, there was no code accessible for creating these tables. But with the available data, we can find a way to reproduce them anyway!\n\nFirst, we want to create a table that summarizes results of descriptive statistics of tests, similar to Table 4 [@2021: 1126]. The {knitr} and {kableExtra} packages have to be loaded to proceed. As a first step, we assign a variable that contains the scores for both datasets (L1 and L2 production) and use the `describe()` function to get all the important measures.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndescriptive_stats_tests <- data.frame(L1pro, L2pro) |> \n  describe()\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo reproduce the original table, the first two columns (`vars` and `n`) are removed.

In the L1 production test, scores were shown to be generally higher than in L2 production test.\n\nNow we want to do the same with the results of reliability testing, namely the alpha coefficients. To display these results, we want to create a table similar to Table 5 in the paper [@2021: 1126]. To accomplish this, we first need to apply the `alpha()` function to calculate Cronbach’s alpha and 95% confidence intervals for two vocabulary tests (A and B) at two proficiency levels (L1 and L2).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nalpha_A_L1 <- alpha(VocabularyA_L1production[,-1], warnings = FALSE)\nalpha_A_L2 <- alpha(VocabularyA_L2production[,-1], warnings = FALSE)\nalpha_B_L1 <- alpha(VocabularyB_L1production[,-1], warnings = FALSE)\nalpha_B_L2 <- alpha(VocabularyB_L2production[,-1], warnings = FALSE)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen we use `sprintf()` to create a summary table showing the reliability estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each test and level, and format strings for the table.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nalpha_table <- data.frame(\n  Vocabulary = c(\"Vocabulary A\", \"Vocabulary B\"),\n  \n  Alpha_L1 = c(\n    sprintf(\"%.2f\", alpha_A_L1$total$raw_alpha),\n    sprintf(\"%.2f\", alpha_B_L1$total$raw_alpha)\n  ),\n  CI_L1 = c(\n    sprintf(\"[%.2f - %.2f]\", alpha_A_L1$feldt$lower.ci, alpha_A_L1$feldt$upper.ci),\n    sprintf(\"[%.2f - %.2f]\", alpha_B_L1$feldt$lower.ci, alpha_B_L1$feldt$upper.ci)\n  ),\n  \n  Alpha_L2 = c(\n    sprintf(\"%.2f\", alpha_A_L2$total$raw_alpha),\n    sprintf(\"%.2f\", alpha_B_L2$total$raw_alpha)\n  ),\n  CI_L2 = c(\n    sprintf(\"[%.2f - %.2f]\", alpha_A_L2$feldt$lower.ci, alpha_A_L2$feldt$upper.ci),\n    sprintf(\"[%.2f - %.2f]\", alpha_B_L2$feldt$lower.ci, alpha_B_L2$feldt$upper.ci)\n  ),\n  \n  stringsAsFactors = FALSE\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo rename the column headers, we use the `colnames()` function, using an empty string for \"Vocabulary\".\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncolnames(alpha_table) <- c(\"\", \"Alpha\", \"95% CI\", \"Alpha\", \"95% CI\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nLastly, we want to display the results in a clean, formatted table similarly to the authors, for which we use the `kable()` function.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-alph-co-L1L2 .cell .tbl-cap-location-top tbl-cap='Alpha coefficients for L1 and L2 production test'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nalpha_table |> \n  kable(align = \"lcccc\") %>%\n  add_header_above(c(\" \" = 1, \"L1 production\" = 2, \"L2 production\" = 2))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"empty-cells: hide;border-bottom:hidden;\" colspan=\"1\"></th>\n<th style=\"border-bottom:hidden;padding-bottom:0; padding-left:3px;padding-right:3px;text-align: center; \" colspan=\"2\"><div style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; padding-bottom: 5px; \">L1 production</div></th>\n<th style=\"border-bottom:hidden;padding-bottom:0; padding-left:3px;padding-right:3px;text-align: center; \" colspan=\"2\"><div style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; padding-bottom: 5px; \">L2 production</div></th>\n</tr>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\">  </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> Alpha </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> 95% CI </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> Alpha </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:center;\"> 95% CI </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Vocabulary A </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 0.84 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> [0.73 - 0.91] </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 0.82 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> [0.71 - 0.91] </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Vocabulary B </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 0.74 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> [0.58 - 0.86] </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> 0.73 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:center;\"> [0.56 - 0.86] </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf we compare @tbl-alph-co-L1L2 about alpha coefficients with the one in the paper [@2021: 1126], we notice a difference in confidence intervals, specifically in the hundredths place. If we look at the output of `alpha()`, we see that it outputs out two kinds of confidence intervals: Feldt and Duhachek. Reading up in the help file of the `?alpha()` function, it becomes clear that `alpha.ci` (used to access CIs from the alpha function) computes CIs following the Feldt procedure, which is based on the mean covariance, while Duhachek's procedure considers the variance of the covariances. In the help file it is stated that, in March 2022m `alpha.ci` was updated to follow the Feldt procedure. Since the original publication was published in 2021, this might explain the deviating CIs here. If one would like to look at Duhachek's CI instead, it can either be seen in the output of `alpha()`, or one might install an earlier version of the package. Since we want to use the current {psych} package for our project and the differences don't change the main outcome, we decided to stick with Feldt's CI and simply wanted to point out why we observe these differences here.\n\nAs mentioned before, Cronbach's alpha indicates whether responses are consistent between items, and ranges between 0 and 1, a higher value meaning higher reliability. As we can see in the results of the reliability analysis, alpha coefficients range from .73 to .84, showing adequate reliability for all the tests.\n\n# Generalized linear mixed-effects models\n\n@2021 used generalized linear mixed-effect models (GLMMs), which are an extension of linear mixed models (see @sec-MLR). GLMM analysis was employed to examine three predictor variables: Learning Condition (L2 to L1 and L1 to L2), Test Type (L1 production and L2 production), and Vocabulary Size (L2 Proficiency), as well as the interaction between two variables. They tried to predict Accuracy (the outcome variable) as a function of these predictor variables.\n\nThree GLMMs were chosen for this analysis, the first to analyze the relationship between learning conditions and production tests (RQ1) [@2021: 1125]. The second and third models analyze the effects of the two learning directions (L2 to L1 and L1 to L2) based on the results of the production tests (RQ2). They are pretty similar, except that the third and last model also make use of L2 production test scores. The first model (RQ 1) will be elaborated in more detail.\n\n## Effects of Learning Condition (RQ1)\n\nAs we recall from the introduction, the first research question of the study was: Which learning direction is more effective for vocabulary acquisition, L1 to L2 learning or L2 to L1 learning? Therefore, the first model was built to analyze the relationship between the outcomes of the production tests and the learning conditions. It contained Learning Condition and Test Type as predictor variables, as well as the interaction of the two variables. Random effects (Subject and Item) were included, and production test answers were used as the outcome variable [@2021: 1125].\n\nBefore getting started on the model, several packages have to be installed and loaded:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(lme4) # package for mixed models\nlibrary(effects) # package for plotting model effects\nlibrary(emmeans) # package for post-hoc comparisons\nlibrary(phia) # similar to {emmeans}\n```\n:::\n\n\nAlso, the data needs to be set up for modeling. Following the code in @2021, the test type (`Test`) and the learning direction (`Condition`) variables are converted to factor variables as they represent categories rather than numerical values. Converting the variables into factors now will also be useful for the statistical analysis such as an ANOVA (Analysis of Variance), which will be conducted later. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndat$Test <- as.factor(dat$Test)\ndat$Condition <- as.factor(dat$Condition)\n```\n:::\n\n\nBefore fitting the models, @2021 also apply **contrast coding**, also called **treatment coding** [@1992]. While it may look confusing and maybe intimidating, it is actually quite an important step. Basically, the study aims to compare two groups (L1 -\\> L2 vs. L2 -\\> L1). @2021 use **simple coding**, where the first Condition (L1 -\\> L2) gets coded as -0.5 and the second Condition (L2 -\\> L1) as +0.5. This makes interpretations easier when there are interactions since the intercept represents the overall mean across the two conditions [@2022].\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nc <- contr.treatment(2)\nmy.coding <- matrix(rep(1/2, 2, ncol = 1))\nmy.simple <- c-my.coding\nmy.simple\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n     2\n1 -0.5\n2  0.5\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncontrasts(dat$Test) <- my.simple\ncontrasts(dat$Condition) <- my.simple\n```\n:::\n\n\nAlso, the `scale()` function is applied to the `Vocab` column to create a standardized version of the variable (by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation). All these steps set up the dataset for statistical modeling. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndat$s.vocab <- scale(dat$Vocab)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Model 1 without interaction\n\n@2021 fit a logistic mixed-effects regression model predicting learners' vocabulary production accuracy (`Answer`) as a function of `Test`, `Condition`, and their interaction with the `glmer()` function. We want to go through the process step-by-step, and connect the authors' original code with the interpretation of the model in the paper.\n\nThe following code chunk shows how Terai et al. fit an initial model without any interactions (`fit1`). Subsequently, the authors calculated the AIC (Akike Information Criterion) for their model. We will explain more about this criterion later.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Model without interaction\nfit1 <- glmer(Answer ~ Test + Condition + (1|ID) + (1|ItemID), \n              family = binomial, \n              data = dat, \n              glmerControl(optimizer = \"bobyqa\"))\n\n# Produce result summary\nsummary(fit1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nGeneralized linear mixed model fit by maximum likelihood (Laplace\n  Approximation) [glmerMod]\n Family: binomial  ( logit )\nFormula: Answer ~ Test + Condition + (1 | ID) + (1 | ItemID)\n   Data: dat\nControl: glmerControl(optimizer = \"bobyqa\")\n\n      AIC       BIC    logLik -2*log(L)  df.resid \n   2429.8    2458.1   -1209.9    2419.8      2145 \n\nScaled residuals: \n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-3.4028 -0.6501 -0.3270  0.7222  5.6099 \n\nRandom effects:\n Groups Name        Variance Std.Dev.\n ItemID (Intercept) 0.9467   0.9730  \n ID     (Intercept) 0.8176   0.9042  \nNumber of obs: 2150, groups:  ItemID, 40; ID, 28\n\nFixed effects:\n            Estimate Std.

In the model formula, both fixed effects (Test answers and learning condition) and random effects (ID and ItemID) are specified. Specifying `(1 | ID)` allows for a random intercept for each level of the variable `ID` (participants) and `(1 | ItemID)` does the same for each level of the variable `ItemID` (test items). This accounts for repeated measures and inter-individual and inter-item variability. By specifying `family = binomial`, we can tell the `glmer()` function that the outcome variable is binary (correct answer = 1, incorrect answer = 0). The last argument specifies an optimizing algorithm, which helps the model to converge. The authors used the `summary()` function to examine the output of the model.\n\nWithout the interaction, the model assumes that the effects of `Test` and `Condition` are additive and do not depend on each other in any way. The AIC is a measure used to estimate the fit of a model to the data in comparison to another one, with a lower AIC indicating better fit. Therefore, we will get back to this after fitting the model with interaction to compare the performance of the two models.\n\nIf we look at the output of the model `summary()`, it includes *scaled residuals*. Residuals are the differences between observed and predicted values (see @sec-MLR). This section shows summary statistics of the model's residuals after scaling: Minimum, first quartile (25^th^ percentile), median (50^th^ percentile), third quartile (75^th^ percentile), and maximum. These values give an impression of how well the model fits the data. The *Random effects* section computes the estimated variability in the intercept across subjects (ID) and items (ItemID), accounting for differences in overall accuracy between participants and between items.\n\n### Model 1 with interaction\n\nNext, the authors fit a model similar to the first one, except that it also models an interaction between `Test` and `Condition`, thus investigating if the effect of one predictor variable depends on the level of the other.\n\nFor this model `fit1.1`, the `glmer()` function was used as well, but with a change in the formula: the predictors are connected with `*` instead of `+`. In addition to the model's coefficient estimates and the AIC, @2021 also calculated confidence intervals for the model using the function `confint()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Model with interaction\nfit1.1 <- glmer(Answer ~ Test * Condition + (1|ID) + (1|ItemID), \n                family = binomial, \n                data = dat, \n                glmerControl(optimizer = \"bobyqa\"))\nsummary(fit1.1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nGeneralized linear mixed model fit by maximum likelihood (Laplace\n  Approximation) [glmerMod]\n Family: binomial  ( logit )\nFormula: Answer ~ Test * Condition + (1 | ID) + (1 | ItemID)\n   Data: dat\nControl: glmerControl(optimizer = \"bobyqa\")\n\n      AIC       BIC    logLik -2*log(L)  df.resid \n   2427.1    2461.1   -1207.6    2415.1      2144 \n\nScaled residuals: \n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-3.2386 -0.6340 -0.3341  0.7195  5.3153 \n\nRandom effects:\n Groups Name        Variance Std.Dev.\n ItemID (Intercept) 0.9518   0.9756  \n ID     (Intercept) 0.8222   0.9067  \nNumber of obs: 2150, groups:  ItemID, 40; ID, 28\n\nFixed effects:\n                 Estimate Std.

We want to find these results in the output of our code. When we look at the summary output of `fit1.1` under Fixed effects, the numbers can be found in the \"Test2\" row. They are all rounded up to three digits for better readability. The negative estimate tells us that accuracy in Test 2 is predicted to be lower than in Test 1. The *p*-value can be extracted from the column marked Pr(\\>\\|z\\|), where it is displayed in the form of \\<2e-16, since it is such a small number. It tells us that the effect (of switching between test types) is significant. The *z*-value tells us how many standard deviations away a value is from the mean.\n\nMoving on to **Learning Condition**, the authors found no statistically significant main effect: Condition2: β = -0.038, SE = 0.103, z = -0.366, p = .714) [@2021: 1126]. In this case, the *p*-value is \\> 0.05, meaning that the effect of learning condition is *not* significantly different from no effect. The main effect estimate of Condition2 is quite small (close to 0), telling us the predicted odds don't change much when moving from one learning condition to the other. However, the **interaction** of Test Type and Learning Condition (see row \"Test2:Condition2\") was shown to be significant (β = -0.446, SE = 0.206, z = -2.169, p = .030) [@2021: 1126]. The interaction term suggests that the effect of `Test` on accuracy depends on the `Condition`, or the other way around. The estimate tells us that, when participants take the L2 production test after learning in the L2 -\\> L1 direction, **the accuracy is even lower than when only one of them is**. The *p*-value of .030 indicates that this observed interaction effect is unlikely to be observed in a sample of this size if the interaction effect were actually null.\n\n### Model comparison\n\n@2021 conducted further analysis and comparisons of the two models, using the function `anova()`, which is an analysis of variance (a statistical method which compares the variance across the means of different groups), and `testInteractions()`, which makes it possible to perform simple main effects analysis. First, the authors conducted a comparison of the models with and without the interaction term using the `anova()` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nanova(fit1, fit1.1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nData: dat\nModels:\nfit1: Answer ~ Test + Condition + (1 | ID) + (1 | ItemID)\nfit1.1: Answer ~ Test * Condition + (1 | ID) + (1 | ItemID)\n       npar    AIC    BIC  logLik -2*log(L) Chisq Df Pr(>Chisq)  \nfit1      5 2429.8 2458.1 -1209.9    2419.8                      \nfit1.1    6 2427.1 2461.1 -1207.5    2415.1 4.669  1    0.03071 *\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n@2021 compared the two models with the `anova()` function to test if the interaction term improved the model. The test outputs a *p*-value of 0.03071. Being smaller than 0.05, the effect is statistically significant, which is also symbolized by the \\* specified in the significance codes in the output. It tells us that `fit1.1` (model with interaction) fits the data significantly better than `fit1` (without interaction).\n\n### Pairwise comparisons on the effects of `Condition` and `Test`\n\nAfter comparing the models and testing the interaction, @2021 conducted pairwise comparisons on the effects of `Condition` and `Test`.\n\nFor this, the authors used the `emmeans()` function, which computes estimated marginal means. First, they conducted pairwise comparisons of Condition levels within each level of Test, and assigned it to a variable `a`.

We want to go through the authors' statements and connect them with the code we reproduced. In the paper, the authors claim there was a statistically significant difference between the scores of the two tests, suggesting that L1 production test scores were higher than L2 production test scores in both learning conditions (**L2 to L1 learning:** *p* \\< .001, *d* = 1.20, 95% CI \\[0.91, 1.49\\]; **L1 to L2 learning:** *p* \\< .001, *d* = 0.75, \\[0.47, 1.04\\]) [@2021: 1126]. Now, we want to take a close look at these numbers and what they mean. We can find the numbers stated here in the object `b` output by the `emmeans()` function. The *p*-values show up when printing `b`, and lie \\< .001 for both learning conditions. A small *p*-value tells us that an effect is unlikely due to chance, but does not inform us about how large the effect is. This is where effect size comes into play: The function `eff_size()` computes the estimated effect sizes for both conditions, which are referred to as *d* in the paper. They both demonstrate a large (larger for L2 to L1) effect size, and indicate that the difference (different levels of `Test` within each `Condition`) is not just statistically significant, but also sizeable. Lastly, the `confint()` function applied to `b` computes the 95% confidence intervals for both learning directions, which means that, if the study were to be repeated many times, in 95% of the repetitions, the 95% confidence interval would contain the true standardized effect size.\n\nThe authors also mention that results showed no main effects of **Learning Condition** (L1 production test: *p* = .188, *d* = -0.19, 95% CI \\[-0.46, 0.09\\]; L2 production test: *p* = .082, *d* = 0.26, \\[-0.03, 0.55\\]) [@2021: 1126]. This can be derived when we look at object `a`, which compares learning conditions separately for L1 Production and L2 Production. Printing `a` returns *p*-values which lie above 0.05 in both production tests and indicate no statistical significance of the differences between learning conditions. The effect sizes show a small negative effect for L1 Production, and a small positive effect for L2 Production. The confidence intervals in both cases include 0 (since it lies between -0.03 and 0.55, for example), telling us that no effect (*d* = 0) is a possibility given the data. To sum up, all these values do *not* support a main effect of Learning Condition, as the authors make clear in their paper.\n\n### Visualizing Model 1\n\nFinally, the authors presented the results of this model in a plot that visualizes all important information regarding research question 1 [@2021: 1127]. In the following code chunk, you can see how they set graphical parameters and then created a base `R` plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npar(pty = \"s\") # sets the shape: square\npar(pin =c(10, 10)) # sets the plot size\npar(\"ps\") # font size\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell .fig-cap-location-bottom}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(allEffects(fit1.1), multiline = T, ci.style = \"bands\", xlab = \"Test Type\", ylab = \"Accuracy Rate\",\n       main = \"\", lty = c(1,2), rescale.axis = F, ylim = c(0, 1),\n       colors = \"black\", asp = 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Interaction between Test Type and Learning Condition on accuracy rates](Retrieval_files/figure-html/fig-testlearn-direc-1.png){#fig-testlearn-direc width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n@fig-testlearn-direc shows the interaction between Test Type and Learning Condition on accuracy rates, based on the generalized linear mixed-effects model (`fit1.1`). It is an effect plot generated with the `allEffects()` function. The solid line represents the L1 to L2 learning condition; the dotted line represents the L2 to L1 learning condition. The *y*-axis represents accuracy rates on both the L1 and L2 production tests. The *x*-axis represents the two test types. We can see that the accuracy rates differ across Test Types and Learning Conditions, with a clear interaction between the two: The non-parallel lines indicate that the effect of one variable changes depends on the level of the other variable. The distance between the two lines is relatively small at each test type, which reflects the results that revealed no significant difference in learning effects between L2 to L1 learning and L1 to L2 learning.\n\nGenerally, @2021 used base `R` plots in their original code. While there is nothing wrong with that, one could also use {ggplot2}, which provides many options to customise the plot. Also, it makes it easy to see what is plotted and how specific elements are modified, which can contribute to the reproducibility of the code. If you want to learn more about using {ggplot2}, check out @sec-DataViz.\n\n## Effects of Learning Directions and L2 Proficiency (RQ2)\n\n@2021 hypothesized that the effectiveness of learning direction or word pairs might be dependent on the learners' proficiency in English. In other words, lower-proficiency learners might benefit more from practicing in the L2 -\\> L1 direction, whilst higher-proficiency learners might benefit more from the L1 -\\> L2 direction.\n\nTo answer and test this question, the authors once again fit two separate generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) for the L1 and L2 production tests. Before we work through the authors' code step-by-step, we need to know what we are working with here: Our outcome variable is the accuracy on production tests and our predictor variables are the learning direction (L1 -\\> L2 vs. L2 -\\> L1) and participants' vocabulary size (which is used as a proxy for English proficiency in this study). The random effects are Participant ID and Item ID so that the model can account for individual differences across participants and the property of individual vocabulary items.\n\n### L1 Production test\n\nWe begin by focusing only on the L1 production data. In the script they provided, the authors loaded the data again for this part and stored it as another object. However, we will continue to use `dat`  to reproduce the code, instead. The authors used the function `filter()`, which only keeps the rows for the L1 Production test. This data is filtered because, while each participant took both L1 and L2 production tests, the authors found different patterns for both test types, which is why they chose to analyze them separately [@2021: 1126]. This is the part where participants of the study had to produce the L1 (Japanese) word when shown the L2 (English) word.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndat.L1 <- filter(dat, Test == \"L1 Production\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nNext, the learning directions (Condition) were converted to a factor. @2021 converted the categories (L1 -\\> L2 vs. L2 -\\> L1) into two factor levels so that `R` treats it as a categorical binary variable.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Setting Condition (Learning direction) as a factor\n\ndat.L1$Condition <- as.factor(dat.L1$Condition)\n```\n:::\n\n\nHere, too, the authors make use of contrast coding once more and standardised vocabulary scores:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nc <- contr.treatment(2)\nmy.coding <- matrix(rep(1/2, 2, ncol = 1))\nmy.simple <- c-my.coding\n\ncontrasts(dat.L1$Condition) <- my.simple\n\ndat.L1$s.vocab <- scale(dat.L1$Vocab)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Model without interaction\n\nThis model without interaction assumes that learning direction and L2 proficiency each have independent effects on test accuracy.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfit2 <- glmer(Answer ~ s.vocab + Condition + # <1>\n                (1|ID) + (1|ItemID), # <2>\n            family = binomial, # <3>\n            data = dat.L1, \n            glmerControl(optimizer = \"bobyqa\"))\n\nsummary(fit2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nGeneralized linear mixed model fit by maximum likelihood (Laplace\n  Approximation) [glmerMod]\n Family: binomial  ( logit )\nFormula: Answer ~ s.vocab + Condition + (1 | ID) + (1 | ItemID)\n   Data: dat.L1\nControl: glmerControl(optimizer = \"bobyqa\")\n\n      AIC       BIC    logLik -2*log(L)  df.resid \n   1316.3    1341.2    -653.1    1306.3      1070 \n\nScaled residuals: \n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-2.7382 -0.7161 -0.2849  0.7304  3.1811 \n\nRandom effects:\n Groups Name        Variance Std.Dev.\n ItemID (Intercept) 0.9085   0.9531  \n ID     (Intercept) 0.8452   0.9194  \nNumber of obs: 1075, groups:  ItemID, 40; ID, 28\n\nFixed effects:\n            Estimate Std.

The model formula includes main effects of learning condition and proficiency plus their interaction.\n2. The model formula also includes random intercepts for participants and items (to account for repeated measures).\n3. This is necessary because our outcome is binary (correct/incorrect).\n\nFurther, @2021 computed the model's AIC.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nAIC(fit2) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1316.26\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe model predicts the probability of a correct response (`Answer`). The random intercepts (`1|ID`) and (`1|ItemID`) account for individual differences between participants and for the unique difficulty of individual vocabulary items. The summary output of this model without interaction shows that `s.vocab` is not a significant predictor of retrieval accuracy with *p* = .57, which suggests that English proficiency by itself does not make a statistically significant contribution to the prediction of participants' L1 Production accuracy. The model also suggests that the test `Condition` does not make a statistically significant contribution to the predictive accuracy of the model (*p* = .18), meaning that learning direction alone also does not explain differences. So, if we look at each predictor separately, there seems to be no clear effect.\n\n### Model with Interaction\n\nWhat if English proficiency only matters in one of the two learning directions?

Basically, the plot tells us that, for lower proficiency learners, L2 -\\> L1 is better, and for higher proficiency learners, L1 -\\> L2 is more beneficial [@2021: 1128].\n\n### L2 Production Test\n\n@2021 repeated all the same steps for the L2 production test, now predicting accuracy for when the participants had to produce English words after learning Japanese-English pairs.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Filtering the data we need\ndat.L2 <- filter(dat, Test == \"L2 Production\")\n\n# Setting Condition as factors\ndat.L2$Condition <- as.factor(dat.L2$Condition)\n\nc <- contr.treatment(2)\nmy.coding <- matrix(rep(1/2, 2, ncol = 1))\nmy.simple <- c-my.coding\n\ncontrasts(dat.L2$Condition) <- my.simple \n\n# Scaling Vocab scores\ndat.L2$s.vocab <- scale(dat.L2$Vocab)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Model without interaction\nfit3 <- glmer(Answer ~ s.vocab+Condition + (1|ID) + (1|ItemID),\n              family = binomial, \n              data = dat.L2, \n              glmerControl(optimizer = \"bobyqa\"))\nsummary(fit3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nGeneralized linear mixed model fit by maximum likelihood (Laplace\n  Approximation) [glmerMod]\n Family: binomial  ( logit )\nFormula: Answer ~ s.vocab + Condition + (1 | ID) + (1 | ItemID)\n   Data: dat.L2\nControl: glmerControl(optimizer = \"bobyqa\")\n\n      AIC       BIC    logLik -2*log(L)  df.resid \n   1146.5    1171.4    -568.3    1136.5      1070 \n\nScaled residuals: \n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-2.2217 -0.5586 -0.3314  0.6289  5.0300 \n\nRandom effects:\n Groups Name        Variance Std.Dev.\n ItemID (Intercept) 1.5602   1.249   \n ID     (Intercept) 0.8818   0.939   \nNumber of obs: 1075, groups:  ItemID, 40; ID, 28\n\nFixed effects:\n            Estimate Std.

We can see that the model *with* interaction has a lower AIC (1145.32) than the one without interaction (1146.52), which --as we remember-- means that the model with the interaction is a better fit. Now, taking a look at the output of the `summary()` function, we see that the Vocabulary Size coefficient estimate is -0.227 (SE = 0.193, *z* = 1.179, *p* = .238). Our *p*-value is greater than 0.05, which means the effect is not statistically significant and proficiency alone does predict accuracy on the L2 production test. We see something nearly identical for the Learning condition with an estimate of -0.262 (SE = 0.154, *z* = -1.699, *p* = 0.089). This means that the performance is not predicted to significantly differ between the two learning directions. In a final step, the interaction term `s.vocab * Condition` was considered, which was also not statistically significant (β = -0.278, SE = 0.154, *z* = -1.810, *p* = .070).\n\n### Visualization\n\n\n::: {.cell .fig-cap-location-bottom}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(allEffects(fit3.1), multiline = T, ci.style = \"bands\", xlab = \"Vocabulary Size\", ylab = \"Accuracy Rate\",\n       main = \"\", lty = c(1, 2), rescale.axis = F, ylim = c(0, 1), colors = \"black\", asp = 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Predicted L2 Production accuracy across vocabulary size and learning direction](Retrieval_files/figure-html/fig-l2-1.png){#fig-l2 width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nJust as the summary statistics of the model above suggested, @fig-l2 shows that, while there was no significance of the results for learning direction or L2 proficiency, the trend bears similartiy to the results of our L1 production test (flatter L2 -\\> L1 slope, steeper L1 -\\> L2 slope). So, for lower-proficiency learners, L2 -\\> L1 leads to higher performance than L1 -\\> L2 learning. Furthermore, the authors explained that L2 -\\> L1 learning is much less influenced by L2 proficiency [@2021: 1128], which is clearly illustrated by the nearly flat dashed line in the graphs.\n\n### Interpretation & Take-home message\n\nGenerally, for the L1 production test, @2021's results showed that lower-proficiency learners benefited more from the L2 -\\> L1 learning direction, while higher-proficiency learners benefited more from the L1 -\\> L2 learning direction. For the L2 production test, a similar trend was observed, but it was not statistically significant, which calls for replication and further research. Overall, vocabulary proficiency shapes how effectively retrieval works: the optimal learning direction is not a one-size-fits-all matter, but may rather be dependent on learner proficiency. However, it is also worth highlighting that only a single language pair was tested in this study. Assuming that the above-mentioned results are generalisable L1-L2 effects may be a bit far-fetched.\n\n## Checking multicollinearity\n\nNow, before interpreting these results too confidently, one should also check whether the predictors are highly correlated with one another, which would be a problem called multicollinearity (see @sec-ModelAssumptions) that might affect the results of our GLMMs.\n\nWhy does this matter? If the predictors are very strongly correlated, the model might have trouble to keep apart their unique contributions. It might then inflate standard errors and thus make estimates unreliable [@2018].\n\nA common diagnostic here is the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF). A VIF close to 1 means predictors are not collinear. Here are some rules: VIF = 1: perfect independence, VIF \\> 5: potential concern, VIF \\> 10: serious multicollinearity [@2018].\n\n### Calculating VIFs for the Models\n\n@2021 used a helper function `vif.mer()` to calculate VIFs for mixed models, which can be directly imported from GitHub using the `source()` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsource(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aufrank/R-hacks/master/mer-utils.R\")\n\nvif.mer(fit1.1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n           Test2       Condition2 Test2:Condition2 \n        1.001121         1.004295         1.004777 \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvif.mer(fit2.1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n           s.vocab         Condition2 s.vocab:Condition2 \n          1.000008           1.000044           1.000049 \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvif.mer(fit3.1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n           s.vocab         Condition2 s.vocab:Condition2 \n          1.000152           1.001814           1.001678 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAll the VIF values are obviously quite close to 1. This means that the predictors (s.vocab, Condition, and their interaction) are not correlated with each other in problematic ways. We can therefore be confident that the estimates of the interaction effects that were observed in the GLMMS are not due to multicollinearity.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nYou are now familiar with the interpretation of generalized linear mixed models! You have learned how to fit them, interpret their main effects and interactions, as well as checking for multicollinearity using the VIF measure. GLMMs are powerful tools for predicting binary outcomes such as true-false accuracy measures. They allow us to account for repeated measures across participants and items such as we encountered in this study by @2021. It is completely normal that at times GLMMs can feel intimidating: coding contrasts and interpreting the outcomes are not always straightforward. But there is always a solution. The insights we can gain from a nicely fitted model make all this effort worthwhile.\n\nOwing to the fact that @2021 published their dataset and `R` code along with the publication, we were able to reproduce their findings and gain hands-on experience with modeling. This chapter does not include the reproduction and explanation of every part of the code that the authors shared, as we focused on the analyses discussed in @2021. In the reproduced code, we only changed minor things, like not reloading the same dataset several times under a different name. This sort of project not only helps with our understanding of the study, but it also sharpens our skills as future SLA researchers.\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n#### **How to cite this chapter** {.unnumbered}\n\nThis is a case study chapter of the web version of the textbook \"Data Analysis for the Language Sciences: A very gentle introduction to statistics and data visualisation in R\" by Elen Le Foll.\n\nPlease cite the current version of this chapter as:\n\n> ::: {style=\"color: black\"}\n> Boxleitner, Hannah and Beyhan Aliy. 2025.
